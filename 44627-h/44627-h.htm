<h2>INTRODUCTORY</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="smcap">ild</span>, weird, and mystic pictures are formed in
the mind by the very name&mdash;the Painted
Desert. The sound itself suggests a fabled rather than
a real land. Surely it must be akin to Atlantis or the
Island of Circe or the place where the Cyclops lived.
Is it not a land of enchantment and dreams, not a place
for living men and women, Indians though they be?</p>

<p>It <i>is</i> a land of enchantment, but also of stern reality,
as those who have marched, unprepared, across its
waterless wastes can testify. No fabled land ever surpassed
it in its wondrousness, yet a railway runs directly
over it, and it is not on some far-away continent, but is
close at hand; a portion, indeed, of our own United
States.</p>

<p>In our schoolboy days we used to read of the Great
American Desert. The march of civilization has
marched that "desert" out of existence. Is the Painted
Desert a fiction of early geographers, like unto the
Great American Desert, to be wiped from the map when
we have more knowledge?</p>

<p>No! It is in actual existence as it was when first seen
by the white men, about three hundred and fifty years ago,
and as it doubtless will be for untold centuries yet to
come.</p>

<p>Coronado and his band of daring conquistadors, preceded
by Marcos de Niza and Stephen the Negro,
reaching out with gold-lustful hands, came into the
region from northern Mexico, conquered Cibola&mdash;Zuni&mdash;and
from there sent out a small band to investigate
the stories told by the Zunis of a people who
lived about one hundred miles to the northwest, whom
they called A-mo-ke-vi. The Navaho Indians said the
home of the A-mo-ke-vi was a Ta-sa-&ucirc;n&acute;&mdash;a country
of isolated buttes&mdash;so the Spaniards called the people
Moki (Moqui) and their land "the province of
Tusayan," and by those names they have ever since been
known.</p>

<p>Yet these names are not the ones by which they designate
themselves and their land. They are the Hopituh,
which Stephen says means "the wise people," and
Fewkes, "the people of peace."</p>

<p>It was in marching to the land of the Hopituh that
the Spaniards designated the region "el pintado desierto."
And a painted desert it truly is. Elsewhere I have
described some of its horrors,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> for I have been familiar
with them, more or less, for upwards of twenty years.
I do not write of that of which I have merely heard, but
"mine eyes have seen," again and again, that which I
describe. I have been almost frozen in its piercing
snow-storms; choked with sand in its whirling
sand-storms; wet through ere I could dismount from my
horse in its fierce rain-storms; terrified and temporarily
blinded by the brilliancy of its lightning-storms; and
almost sunstruck by the scorching power of the sun in
its desolate confines. I have seen the sluggish waters
of the Little Colorado River rise several feet in the
night and place an impassable barrier temporarily before
us. With my horses I have camped, again and again,
waterless, on its arid and inhospitable rocks and sands,
and prayed for morning, only to resume our exhausting
journey in the fiercely beating rays of the burning sun;
longing for some pool of water, no matter how dirty,
how stagnant, that our parched tongues and throats
might feel the delights of swallowing something fluid.
And last year (1902), in a journey to the home of the
Hopi, my friends and I saw a part of this desert covered
with the waters of a fierce rain-storm as if it were an
ocean, and the "dry wash" of the Oraibi the scene of a
flood that, for hours, equalled the rapids of the Colorado
River. We were almost engulfed in a quicksand, and a
few days later covered with a sand-storm; all these experiences,
and others, in the course of a few days.</p>

<p>Stand with me on the summit of one of the towering
mountains that guard the region and you will see such
a landscape of color as exists nowhere else in the world.
It suggests the thought of God's original palette&mdash;where
He experimented in color ere He decided how
to paint the sunset, tint the sun-kissed hills at dawn,
give red to the rose, green to the leaves, yellow to the
sunflowers, and the varied colors of baby blue-eyes, violets,
portulacas, poppies, and cacti; where He concluded
to distribute color throughout His world instead
of making it all sombre in grays or black.</p>

<p>Look! here is a vast flat of alkali, pure, dazzling
white, shining like a vivid and horrible leprosy in the
noon-day sun; close by is an area of volcanic action
where a veritable "tintaro"&mdash;inkstand&mdash;has overflowed
in devastating blackness over miles and miles. There
are pits of six hundred feet depth full of black
gunpowder-like substance, gardens of hellish cauliflowers
and cabbages of forbidding black lava, and tunnels
arched and square of pure blackness. Yonder is a
mural face a half thousand feet high and two hundred
or more miles long. It is nearly a hundred miles
away, yet it reveals the rich glowing red of its walls,
and between it and us are large "blotches" of pinks,
grays, greens, reds, chocolates, carmines, crimsons,
browns, yellows, olives, in every conceivable shade, and
all blending in a strange and grotesque yet attractive
manner, and fascinating while it awes. It is seldom
one can see a rainbow lengthened out into flatness and
then petrified; yet you can see it here. Few eyes have
ever beheld a sunset painted on a desert's sands, yet all
may see it here.</p>

<p>It is a desert, surely, yet throughout its entire width
flows a monster river; a fiendish, evil-souled river; a
thievish, murderous river; a giant vampire, sucking the
life-blood from thousands of square miles of territory
and making it all barren, desolate, desert. And this
vampire river has vampire children which emulate their
mother in their insatiable thirst. Remorselessly they
suck up and carry away all the moisture that would
make the land "blossom as the rose," and thus add
misery to desolation, devastation to barrenness.</p>

<p>It is a desert, surely, yet planted in its dreary wastes
are verdant-clad mountains, on whose summits winter's
snows fall and accumulate, and in whose bosoms springs
of life are harbored.</p>

<p>It is a desert, surely, yet it is fringed here and there
with dense forests, and in the very heart of its direst
desolation threads of silvery streams lined with greenish
verdure seem to give the lie to the name.</p>

<p>It is desert, barren, inhospitable, dangerous, yet
thousands of people make it their chosen home. Over
its surface roam the Bedouins of the United States,
fearless horsemen, daring travellers, who rival in picturesqueness,
if not in evil, their compeers of the deserts
by the Nile. Down in the deep canyon water-ways of
the desert-streams dwell other peoples whose life is as
strange, weird, wild, and fascinating as that of any people
of earth.</p>

</a></div>
<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><span class="smcap">In the Heart of the Petrified Forest.</span></p>

<p>This is the region and these the people I would make
the American reader more familiar with. Other books
have been written on the Painted Desert. One was
published a few years ago, written by a clever American
novelist, and published by one of America's leading
firms, and I read it with mingled feelings of delight
and half anger. It was so beautifully and charmingly
written that one familiar with the scenes depicted could
not fail to enjoy it, although indignant&mdash;because of the
errors that might have been avoided. It claims only
to be fiction. Yet the youth of the land reading it
necessarily gain distinct impressions of fact from its
pages. These "facts" are, unfortunately, so far from
true that they mislead the reader. It would have been
a comparatively slight task for the author to have consulted
government records and thus have made his references
to geography and ethnology correct.</p>

<p>It is needless, I hope, for me to say I have honestly
endeavored to avoid the method here criticised. The
bibliography incorporated as part of this book will
enable the diligent student to consult authorities about
this fascinating region.</p>

<p>But now comes an important question. What are
the boundaries of the Painted Desert? I am free to
confess I do not know, nor do I think any one else does.
The Spaniards never attempted to bound it, and no one
since has ever had the temerity to do so. In Ives's
map of the region he endeavored to explore, and of
which he wrote so hopelessly, he places the Painted
Desert in that ill-defined way that geographers used
to follow in suggesting the location of the Great American
Desert.</p>

<p>The <i>conditions</i> of color and barrenness that first suggested
the name exist over a large area; you find them
in the plateaus of southern Utah and the wild wastes
of southern Nevada; they exist in much of New Mexico
and southwestern Colorado. In Arizona if you sweep
around north, west, south, and east, they are there.
Northward&mdash;in the cliffs and ravines of the Grand Canyon
country, in Blue Canyon, in the red mesas, the coal
deposits, and in the lava flows around the San Francisco
Mountains; westward&mdash;in the wild mountains and
wilder deserts that lead to the crossings of the Colorado
River, past the craters, lava flows, Calico Mountains,
and Mohave Desert of the country adjoining the Santa
F&eacute; Route, and the Salton Sea, mud volcanoes, purple
cliffs, and tawny sands of the Colorado Desert of the
Sunset Route of the Southern Pacific; southward&mdash;in
the Red Rock country, Sunset Pass, the meteorite beds
of Canyon Diablo, the great cliffs of the Mogollon Plateau,
the Tonto Basin, the Verdi Valley, and away down,
over the Hassayampa, through the Salt River Valley,
past the Superstition and other purple and variegated
mountains, into the heart of northern Mexico itself;
eastward&mdash;to the Petrified Forest, across into New
Mexico to Mount San Mateo, by the cliffs, craters, lava
flows, alkali flats, gorges and ravines of the Zuni
Mountain country and as far as the Rio Grande at
Albuquerque, where the basalt is scattered about in an
irregular way, as if the molten stuff had been washed
over the country from some titanic bucket, and left to
lie in great inky blots over the bright-colored soils and
clays.</p>

<p>To me, <i>all this</i> is Painted Desert region, for much of
it is painted and much is desert. Indeed, if one Painted
Desert were to be staked off in any one of the above
named States, ten others, equally large, could be found
in the remaining ones.</p>

<p>It is a wonderful region viewed from any standpoint.
Scenic! It is unrivalled for uniqueness, contrasts, variety,
grandeur, desolateness, and majesty. Geologic! The
student may here find in a few months what a lifetime
elsewhere cannot reveal. Artistic! The artist will find
it his rapture and his despair. Arch&aelig;ologic! Ruins
everywhere, cavate, cliff, and pueblo dwellings, waiting
for investigation, and, doubtless, scores as yet
undiscovered. Ethnologic! Hopi, Wallapai, Havasupai,
Navaho, Apache, and the rest; with mythologies as
fascinating and complex as those of old Greece; with
histories that lose themselves in dim legend and tradition,
and that tell of feuds and wars, massacres and
conflicts, that extend over centuries.</p>

<p>In the first chapter I have briefly named some of the
wonders and marvels of this fascinating land, and though
in barest outline, "the half has not been told."</p>

<p>It will be noticed that I have not rigidly adhered to
the subjects as indicated by the heads of the chapters.
I have preferred a discursive rather than a rigid style,
for I deem it will prove itself the more interesting to the
generality of my readers, and I merely call attention to
it so that my critics may know it is not done without
intent.</p>

<p>Of the Indians of this region I have room to write
of four tribes only, viz., the Hopi, the Navaho, the
Wallapai, and the Havasupai. Of the former much has
been written in late years, owing to the interest centred
in their thrilling religious ceremony, the Snake Dance.
Of the Navaho considerable is known, but of the Wallapai
and Havasupai there is little known and less written.
Indeed, of the Wallapai there is nothing in print except
the brief and cursory remarks of travellers, and the reports
of the teachers of the recently established schools
to the Indian Department. No one is better aware than
myself of the incomplete and fragmentary character of
what I have written, but this book is issued, as others
that have preceded it from my pen, in accord with my
desire to place in compact form for the general reader
reliable accounts of places and peoples in the United
States hitherto known only to the explorer and scientist.</p>

<p>To all the writers of the United States Bureau of
Ethnology and the Smithsonian Institution, as well as
those of other departments of the Government who
have written on the region, I gratefully acknowledge
many indebtednesses, especially to Powell, Fewkes,
Matthews, Stephen, Hodge, Hough, Hrdlicka, Cushing,
and Shufeldt.</p>

<p>To those who know the persistency and conscientiousness
of my labors in my chosen field, and the pains I
take both by observation and from the works of authorities
to gain accurate knowledge, and my <i>over</i>-willingness
to acknowledge by pen and voice those to whom I am
indebted, it will not be necessary to state that I have
endeavored to make this book a standard. If I have
failed to give credit where it was due, I do so now with
an open heart.</p>

<p>For the kindly reception my work in the printed page
and on the platform has received in the past I hereby
express my grateful acknowledgments.</p>

<p class="ph2"><i>THE INDIANS OF THE<br />
Painted Desert Region</i></p>

<h2><a name="ChI." id="ChI."></a>CHAPTER I<br />
<small>THE PAINTED DESERT REGION</small></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">C</span><span class="smcap">ivilization</span> and barbarism obtrude themselves
delightfully at every turn in this Wonderland
of the American Southwest, called the Painted Desert
Region.</p>

<p>Ancient and modern history play you many a game
of hide-and-seek as you endeavor to trace either one or
the other in a study of its aboriginal people; you look
upon a ceremony performed to-day and call it modern.
In reality it is of the past, so old, so hoary with antiquity
that even to the participants it has lost its origin
and much of its meaning.</p>

<p>History&mdash;exciting, thrilling, tragic&mdash;has been made
in the Painted Desert Region; was being made centuries
before Leif Ericson landed on the shores of Vinland,
or John and Sebastian Cabot sailed from Bristol.
History that was ancient and hoar when the band of
pilgrims from Leyden battled with the wild waves of the
Atlantic's New England shore, and was lapsing into
sleepiness before the guns of the minute-men were fired
at Lexington or Allen had fallen at Bunker Hill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Painted Desert Region we find peoples strange,
peculiar, and interesting, whose mythology is more fascinating
than that of ancient Greece, and, for aught we
know to the contrary, may be equally ancient; whose
ceremonies of to-day are more elaborate than those
of a devout Catholic, more complex than those of a
Hindoo pantheist, more weird than those of a howling
dervish of Turkestan.</p>

<p>Peoples whose origin is as uncertain and mysterious
as the ancients thought the source of the Nile; whose
history is unknown except in the fantastic, though stirring
and improbable stories told by the elders as they
gather the young men around them at their mystic
ceremonies, and in the traditional songs sung by their
high priests during the performance of long and exhausting
worship.</p>

<p>Peoples whose government is as simple, pure, and
perfect as that of the patriarchs, and possibly as ancient,
and yet more republican than the most modern government
now in existence. Peoples whose women build
and own the houses, and whose men weave the garments
of the women, knit the stockings of their own wear, and
are as expert with needle and thread as their ancestors
were with bow and arrow, obsidian-tipped spear, or
stone battle-axe.</p>

<p>Here live peoples of peace and peoples of war; wanderers
and stay-at-homes; house-builders and those
who scorn fixed dwelling-places; poets whose songs,
like those of blind Homer and the early Troubadors,
were never written, but enshrined only in the hearts of
the race; artists whose paints are the brilliant sands of
many-colored mountains, and whose brushes are their
own deft fingers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>Its modern history begins about three hundred and
fifty years ago when one portion of it was discovered by
a negro slave, whose amorous propensities lured him
to his death, and the other by a priest, of whom one
writer says his reports were "so disgustful in lyes and
wrapped up in fictions that the Light was little more
than Darkness."</p>

<p>Of its ancient history who can more than guess? To
most questions it remains as silent as the Sphinx. The
riddle of the Sphinx, though, is being solved, and so
by the careful and scientific work of the Bureau of
Ethnology, the riddles of the prehistoric life of our
Southwest, slowly but surely, are being resolved.</p>

<p>One of the countries comprised in the Painted Desert
Region is the theme of an epic, Homerian in style if
not in quality, full of wars and rumors of wars, storming
of impregnable citadels, and the recitals of deeds as
brave and heroic as those of the Greeks at Marathon or
Thermopyl&aelig;; a poem recently discovered, after having
remained buried in the tomb of oblivion for over two
hundred years.</p>

<p>Here are peoples of stupendous religious beliefs.
Peoples who can truthfully be designated as the most
religious of the world; yet peoples as agnostic and
sceptic, if not as learned, as Hume, Voltaire, Spencer,
and Ingersoll. Peoples to whom a written letter is
witchcraft and sorcery, and yet who can read the
heavens, interpret the writings of the woods, deserts,
and canyons with a certainty never failing and unerring.
Peoples who twenty-five years ago stoned and hanged
the witches and wizards they sincerely thought cursed
them, and who, ten years ago hanged, and perhaps even
to-day, though secretly, hang one another on a cross as
an act of virtue and religious faith, after cruelly beating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
themselves and one another with scourges of deadly
cactus thorns.</p>

<p>Here are intelligent farmers, who, for centuries, have
scientifically irrigated their lands, and yet who cut off the
ears of their burros to keep them from stealing corn.</p>

<p>A land it is of witchcraft and sorcery, of horror and
dread of ghosts and goblins, of daily propitiation of
Fates and Powers and Princes of Darkness and Air at
the very thought of whom withering curses and blasting
injuries are sure to come.</p>

<p>Here dwell peoples who dance through fierce, flaming
fires, lacerate themselves with cactus whips, run
long wearisome races over the scorching sands of the
desert, and handle deadly rattlesnakes with fearless
freedom, as part of their religious worship.</p>

<p>Peoples who pray by machinery as the Burmese use
their prayer wheels, and who "plant" supplications as
a gardener "plants" trees and shrubs.</p>

<p>Peoples to whom a smoking cigarette is made the
means of holy communion, the handling of poisonous
reptiles a sacred and solemn act of devotion, and the
playing with dolls the opportunity for giving religious
instruction to their children.</p>

<p>Peoples who are pantheists, sun worshippers, and
snake dancers, yet who have churches and convents
built with incredible labor and as extensive as any modern
cathedral.</p>

<p>Peoples whose conservatism in manners and religion
surpass that of the veriest English tories; who, for hundreds
of years, have steadily and successfully resisted
all efforts to "convert" and change them, and who
to-day are as firm in their ancient faiths as ever. Peoples
whom Spanish conquistadors could not tame with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
matchlock, pike, and machete, nor United States forces
with Gatling gun, rifle, and bayonet.</p>

<p>Peoples to whom fraternal organizations and secret
societies, for men and women alike, are as ancient as the
mountains they inhabit, whose lodge rooms are more
wonderful, and whose signs and passwords more complex
than those of any organization of civilized lands
and modern times.</p>

<p>Peoples industrious and peoples studiously lazy,
honest and able in thievery, truthful and consummate
liars, cleanly and picturesquely dirty, interesting and
repulsively loathsome, charming and artistically hideous,
religious and cursedly wicked, peaceful and unceasingly
warlike, lovers of home and haters of fixed habitations.</p>

<p>Here are peoples who dwell upon almost inaccessible
cliffs, peoples of the clouds, and, on the other hand,
peoples who dwell in canyon depths, where stupendous
walls, capable of enclosing Memphis, Thebes, Luxor,
Karnak, and all the ruins of ancient Egypt, are the
boundaries of their primitive residences.</p>

<p>The Painted Desert Region is a country where rattlesnakes
are washed, prayed over, caressed, carried in the
mouth, and placed before and on sacred altars in religious
worship.</p>

<p>Where the worship of the goddess of reproduction
with all its phallic symbolism is carried on in public
processionals, dances, and ceremonials by men, women,
maidens, and children without shameful self-consciousness,
yet where dire penalties, even unto mutilation
and death, are visited upon the unchaste.</p>

<p>Where polygamy has been as openly practised as in
the days of Abraham, and possibly from as early a time,
and where to-day it is as common to see a man who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
openly, has two or more wives, as in civilized lands it
is common to see him with but one. And yet it is
a land in which polygamy is expressly forbidden by
United States law, and where numbers of arrests have
been made for violation of that law.</p>

<p>Where religious rites are performed, so mystic and
ancient that their meaning is unknown even to the
most learned of those who partake in them.</p>

<p>Indeed, the Painted Desert Region, though a part
of the United States of America, is a land of peoples
strange, unique, complex, diverse, and singular as can
be found in any similar area on the earth, and the
physical contour of the country is as strange and
diverse as are the peoples who inhabit it.</p>

<p>It is a land of gloriously impressive mountains,
crowned with the snows of blessing and bathed in a
wealth of glowing colors, changing hues, and tender
tints that few other countries on earth can boast.</p>

<p>On its eastern outskirt is a portion of one of the
largest cretaceous monoclines in the world, and near by
is a natural inkstand, half a mile in circumference, from
which, centuries ago, flowed fiery, inky lava which has
now solidified in intensest blackness over hundreds of
miles of surrounding country.</p>

<p>It is a land of mountain-high plateaus, edged with
bluffs, cliffs, and escarpments that delight the distant
beholder with their richness of coloring and wondrous
variety of outline, and thrill with horror those who
unexpectedly stand on their brinks.</p>

<p>It is a land of laziness and indifferent content, where
everything is done "poco tiempo"&mdash;"in a little while"&mdash;and
where "to-morrow" is early enough for all
laborious tasks, and yet a land of such tireless energy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
never-ceasing work, and arduous labor as few countries
else have ever known.</p>

<p>A land where people live in refinement, education,
and all the luxuries of twentieth-century civilization
side by side with peoples whose dress, modes of living,
habits of eating and sleeping, styles of food and cookery
are similar to those of the subjects of Boadicea and
Caractacus.</p>

<p>In the Painted Desert Region the root of one
dangerous-looking prickly cactus is used for soap, and
the fruit of another for food.</p>

<p>Here horses dig for water, and mules are stimulated
by whiskey to draw their weighty loads over torrid
deserts and up mountain steeps.</p>

<p>It is a land of ruins, desolate and forlorn, buried and
forgotten, with histories tragic, bloody, romantic; ruins
where charred timbers, ghastly bones, and demolished
walls speak of midnight attacks, treacherous surprises,
and cruel slaughters; where whole cities have been
exterminated and destroyed as if under the ancient
commands to the Hebrews: "Destroy, slay, kill, and
spare not."</p>

<p>A desert country, and yet, in spots, marvellously
fertile. Barren, wild, desolate, forsaken it is, and yet,
here and there, fertile valleys, wooded slopes, and garden
patches may be found as rich as any on earth.</p>

<p>Where atmospheric colorings are so perfect and so
divinely artistic in their applications that weary and desolate
deserts are made dreams of glory and supremest
beauty, and harsh rugged mountains are sublimated
into transcendent pictures of tender tints and ever-changing
but always harmonious combinations of color.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>A land where rain may be seen falling in fifty showers
all around, and yet not a drop fall, <i>for a year or more</i>,
on the spot where the observer stands.</p>

<p>A land of sculptured images and fantastic carvings.
Where water, wind, storm, sand, frost, heat, atmosphere,
and other agencies, unguided and uncontrolled by man,
have combined to make figures more striking, more
real, more picturesque, more ugly, more beautiful, and
more fantastic than those of the angels, devils, saints,
and sinners that crown and adorn the ancient Pagan
shrines of the Orient and the more modern Christian
shrines of the Occident;&mdash;a veritable
Toom-pin-nu-wear-tu-weep&mdash;Land of the Standing Rocks&mdash;more
gigantic, wonderful, and attractive than can be found
elsewhere in the world.</p>

<p>Where sand mountains, yielding alike to the fierce
winds of winter and the gentle breezes of summer,
slowly travel from place to place, irresistibly controlling
fresh sites and burying all that obstructs their path.</p>

<p>A land where, in summer, railway trains are often
stopped by drifting sands blown by scorching winds
over almost trackless Saharas, and where, in winter,
the same trains are stopped by drifting snows blown
over the same Saharas now made Arctic in their frozen
solitude.</p>

<p>A land where once were vast lakes in which disported
ugly monsters, and on the surface of which swam mighty
fish-birds who gazed with curious wonder upon the
enormous reptiles, birds, and animals which came to
lave themselves in the cooling waves or drink of their
refreshing waters.</p>

<p>But now lakes, fishes, reptiles, and animals have
entirely disappeared. Where placid lakes once were
lashed into fury by angry winds are now only sand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
wastes and water-worn rocks where the winds howl
and shriek and rave, and mourn the loss of the waters
with which they used to sport; and the only remnants
of prehistoric fishes, reptiles, and animals are found in
decaying bones or fossilized remains deep imbedded
in the strata of the unnumbered ages.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span class="smcap">Ancient Pottery dug from Prehistoric
Ruins on the Painted Desert.</span></p>

<p>A land where volcanic fires and fierce lava flows,
accompanied by deadly fumes, noxious gases, and
burning flames, have made lurid the midnight skies,
and driven happy people from their peaceful homes.</p>

<p>A land through which a mighty river dashes madly
and unrestrainedly to the sea, and yet where, a few
miles away, a spring that flows a few buckets of water
an hour is an inestimable treasure. Yes indeed, where,
in sight of that giant river, thirsty men have gone
raving mad for want of water, and have hurled themselves
headlong down thousand-feet-high precipices in
their uncontrolled desire to reach the precious and
cooling stream.</p>

<p>A land of rich and florid coloring where the Master
Artist has revelled in matchless combinations. It is a
land of color,&mdash;sweet, gentle, tender colors that penetrate
the soul as the words of a lover; fierce, glaring,
bold colors that strike as with the clenched fist of a
foe.</p>

<p>It is the stage upon which the bronze and white
actors of three hundred and fifty years ago played
their games of life with ambitions, high as they were
selfish, determined as they were bold, and unscrupulous
as they were successful.</p>

<h2><a name="ChII." id="ChII."></a>CHAPTER II<br />
<small>DESERT RECOLLECTIONS</small></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="smcap">f</span> the flora and fauna of the Painted Desert Region
I have made no study. That they are fascinating
the works of Hart Merriam, Coville, Lemmon, Hough,
and others of later days, and of the specialists of the
earlier government surveys, abundantly testify. There
are cacti of varieties into the hundreds, sagebrush, black
and white grama, bunch grass, salt grass, hackberry,
buck-brush, pines, junipers, spruces, cottonwoods, and
willows, besides a thousand flowering plants. There
are lizards, swifts, rattlesnakes, scorpions, Gila monsters,
vinegerones, prairie dogs, hedgehogs, turtles, squirrels,
cottontail and jack-rabbits, antelope, deer, mountain
sheep, wildcats, and some bear.</p>

<p>It is more of its physiographic conditions in a general
way, however, that I would here write.</p>

<p>Most people's conception of a desert is a flat, level
place of nothing but sand. It is sand instead of water;
a desert instead of an ocean. Few deserts conform to
this conception,&mdash;none, indeed, that I know of in the
boundaries of the United States. This Painted Desert
Region is wonderfully diversified. There is sand, of
course, but much rock, many trees, more canyons, some
mountains and lava flows, extinct volcanoes, forests, and
pastures. The Grand Canyon runs across its northern
borders, and it is the vampire river that flows in that
never-to-be-described water-way that drains away the
water which leaves this the desert region it is; for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Colorado has many tributaries, and tributaries of
tributaries,&mdash;the Little Colorado, Havasu (Cataract) Creek,
Canyon Padre, Canyon Diablo, Walnut Creek, Oak
Creek, Willow Creek, Diamond Creek, and a score or
hundred others.</p>

<p>Its great mountains are the San Francisco range, on
the shoulders of which Flagstaff is located, Mount San
Mateo, seen from the Santa F&eacute; train near Grants in New
Mexico, and Williams Mountain, west of Flagstaff, at
the foot of which the railway traveller will see the town
of Williams.</p>

<p>Near Flagstaff are a number of extinct volcanoes and
great masses of lava flow; from the train at Blue Water
to the right a few miles one may see the crater
Tintaro&mdash;the Inkstand. The Zuni Mountains have many
craters, chief of which is the Agua Fria crater, and lava
flows from the Zuni Mountains and Mount San Mateo
meet in the valley, and one rides alongside them for
miles coming west beyond Laguna.</p>

<p>South of Canyon Diablo is a wonderful meteoritic
mountain, the explanation of whose existence the scientists
have not yet determined. From Peach Springs a
large meteoric rock was sent to the Smithsonian, and
I have one dug out of a hole of its own making in the
Zuni Mountains, both of which weigh upwards of a ton.</p>

<p>To the east of the Canyon Diablo Mountain is Sunset
Pass, familiar to the readers of Gen. Charles King's
thrilling Arizona stories, and beyond it to the south
are Hell's Canyon,&mdash;which does not belie its name,&mdash;the
Verdi Valley, and the interesting Red Rock Country,
where numerous cliff and cavate dwellings have recently
been discovered and explored by Dr. Fewkes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Indeed, this whole region is one of cliff and cavate
and other forsaken dwellings. Everywhere one meets
with them. Desert mounds, on examination, prove to
be sites of long-buried cities, and hundreds, nay thousands
of exquisite vessels of clay, decorated in long-forgotten
ways, have been dug up from them and sent to
grace the shelves of museums and speak of a people
long since crumbled to dust.</p>

<p>The miner has found it a profitable field for his
operations, the Jerome and Congress, with the Old
Vulture and similar mines, having made great fortunes
for their owners. More than half our knowledge of
the country came primarily from the daring and courageous
prospectors who risked its dangers and deaths
in their search for gold.</p>

<p>The roads in the Painted Desert are long and tedious,
and the horses drag their weary way over the scorching
sands, the wheels of the wagon sinking in, as does also
the heart of the sensitive rider who sees the efforts the
poor beasts are making to obey his will. Yet the
animals seldom sweat. Such is the rapid radiation of
moisture in this dry, high atmosphere that one never
sees any of the sweat and lather so common to hard-driven
horses in lower altitude.</p>

<p>The food question for horses is often serious if one
goes far from the beaten path of traders or Indians. A
desert is not a pasture, though its scant patches of grass
often have to serve for one. The general custom, where
possible, is to carry a small amount of grain, which
is fed sparingly night and morning. The horses are
hobbled and turned loose in as good pasture as can be
found. Hence the first questions asked when determining
a camping place are, "What kind of pasture
and water does it possess?" There are times when one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
dare not run the risk of turning the horses loose.
Thirsty beyond endurance, they will often travel all
night, even though closely hobbled, back to where the
last water was secured. Then they must be tracked
back, and no more exhausting and disheartening occupation
do I know than this.</p>

<p>On one occasion we were compelled to camp where
there was little pasturage. It rained, and there were
two ladies in my party. The covered wagon was
emptied and their blankets rolled down in it, so that
they could be in shelter. Our driver was a German
named Hank. Two of "his horses were mules," and
these were tied one to each of the front wheels. The
two real horses were tied to the rear wheels. During
the night "Pete," one of the mules, got his fore legs
over the pole of the wagon, and began to tug and pull
so that the ladies were afraid the vehicle might be overturned.
Calling to Hank, the poor fellow was compelled
to get out of his blankets and in the rain go to Pete's
rescue. To their intense amusement the ladies heard
him remonstrating with the refractory mule, and almost
exploded when he wound up his remonstrances, hitherto
couched in quiet and dignified language, "Pete, you
are von little tefel."</p>

<p>Some people do not like to hobble a horse, and so
they picket him. There are different ways of "picketing"
a horse. He may be tied by the halter to a bush,
tree, wagon, or stake driven into the ground. But these
methods are fraught with danger. I once had a valuable
horse at a time when Dr. Joseph LeConte, the beloved
professor of geology of the University of California, was
spending a month with me in the mountains. We had
six horses, and all were "picketed" from the halter, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
a rope around the neck. Three times a day we changed
them to fresh pasturage. At one of the changing times
we found the beautiful black stretched out cold and
stiff. In scratching his head the hoof of his hind foot
had caught in the rope, and in seeking to free himself
he had pulled the rope tighter and tighter until he had
strangled himself. The gentle-hearted professor sat down
and wept at the tragic end of the noble horse "Duke"
he had already learned to love.</p>

<p>To prevent this danger I have often picketed a horse's
hind foot to a log heavy enough to drag, so that the hungry
animal could move a little in search of food, but not
run or get far away. There have been two or three
times, however, in my experience, where I could find
neither tree, bush, nor stake. Not a rock or log could
be found for miles to which the saddle horse I rode
could be picketed. What then could I do? Sit up all
night to care for my horse? Ride all night? Or do
as I heard of one or two men having done, viz., picket
the horse to my own foot? I once heard of a man
who was dragged to his death that way. His cayuse
was startled during the night and started to run. As
the rope tightened and he dragged the unhappy wretch
attached to him, his fear increased his speed, and not
until he was exhausted and breathless did he stop in
his wild, mad race. He was found with the corpse,
bruised and mangled beyond all recognition, still dragging
at the end of the rope.</p>

<p>I had no desire to run such risk. So I did the
impossible,&mdash;picketed my horse to a hole in the ground.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Picket a horse to a hole in the ground?
It can't be done!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>Indeed! But I did it. Watch me. Cut into the
ground (especially if it is a little grassy) and make a hole
a little larger than to allow your full fist to enter. As
you dig deeper widen the hole below so that it is
a kind of a chimney towards the top. Dig fully a foot
or a foot and a half down. Then take the rope, which
is already fastened at the other end to your horse, wrap
the end around a piece of grass, or paper, or a small
stone, or anything; put the knot into the hole, and
"tamp" in the earth as vigorously as you can. Your
horse is then fast, unless he grows desperately afraid
and pulls with more than ordinary vigor.</p>

<p>The scarcity of water makes journeying on the Painted
Desert a grave and serious problem. The springs are
few and far between, and only in the rainy season can
one rely upon stony or clay pockets that fill up with the
precious fluid. In going from Canyon Diablo to Oraibi
there are four places where water may be obtained.
First in a small canyon a few miles west of Volz's
Crossing of the Little Colorado; then at the Lakes,&mdash;small
ponds of dirty, stagnant water, where a trading-post
is located and where the journey is generally
broken for a night. Next day, twenty-two miles must
be driven to Little Burro Spring before water is again
found, and a few miles further on, on the opposite side
of the valley, is Big Burro Spring. Then no more water
is found until Oraibi is reached. There are two springs
on the western side of the Oraibi mesa, and three miles
on the eastern side in the Oraibi Wash is a good well,
some sixty feet deep, of cold and good but not over-clear
water. There are small pools near Mashonganavi,
Shipauluvi, and Shungopavi, but the water is poor at
best and very limited in quantity to those who are used
to the illimitable flow of ordinary Eastern cities. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
whole water supply at Mashonganavi, which is by far
the best watered town of the middle mesa, would not
more than suffice for the needs of a New York or Boston
family of six or eight persons, and consternation would
sit upon the face of the mistress of either household if
such water were to flow through the faucets of her
home.</p>

<p>At Walpi there are three pool springs on the west
side, but all flow slowly. One is good (for the desert),
another is fair, and the third is horrible. Yet this last is
almost equal to the supply on the eastern side, where
there are three pool springs, only two of which can be
used for domestic purposes.</p>

<p>Storms fearful and terrible often sweep across this
desert region. I have "enjoyed" several notable experiences
in them, storms of sand, of rain, of wind, of
lightning, and of thunder, sometimes one kind alone,
other times of a combination of kinds. At one time
we were camped in the Oraibi Wash not far from the
home of the Mennonite missionary, my friend Rev.
H. R. Voth. There were seven of us in my party,&mdash;five
men, two women. Our general custom on making
a camp was first of all to choose the best place for the
beds of the ladies, and then the men arranged their
blankets in picturesque irregularity around them at
some distance away, thus forming a complete guard,
not because of any necessity, but to make the ladies
feel less timid. As my daughter was one of the ladies,
I invariably rolled out my blankets near enough to be
called readily should there be any occasion during the
night.</p>

<p>We had not been in our blankets long, that night,
before a fearful thunder and rain-storm burst upon us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
We had all gone to bed tired after our long and weary
day watching the Hopi ceremonies, and the camp equipage
was not prepared for a storm. It was pitch dark
except for the sharp flashes of lightning which occasionally
cut the blackness into jagged sections, and the
deluge of rain waited for no squeamishness on my part.
Hastily jumping up, I ran to and fro in my bare feet
and night garments, caught up a big wagon sheet, and
endeavored to spread it over the exposed beds of the
ladies. The wind was determined I should not succeed,
but I am English and obstinate. So I seized camera
cases, valises, boxes of canned food, and anything
heavy, and placed them upon the edges of the flapping
canvas. Running back and forth to the wagon, the
lightning every now and again revealed a drenched,
fantastic figure, and I could hear suppressed laughter
and giggles from under the blankets whence should
have issued songs of thankfulness to me. But "it was
ever thus!" I succeeded finally in pinning down the
canvas, and had just rolled my wet and shivering form
in my own drenched blankets, when Mr. Voth, with a
lantern in his hand, came and simply demanded that the
ladies come over to warmth and shelter in his hospitable
house. Hastily wrapping themselves up, they started,
blown about by the wind and flaunted by the tempest.
The sand made it harder still to walk, and out of breath
and wildly dishevelled, they struggled up the bank of
the Wash and were soon comfortably ensconsed indoors.
Then, strange irony of events, the storm immediately
ceased, the heavens cleared, the stars shone bright, the
cool night air became delicious to the nostrils and tired
bodies, and we who remained outside had a sleep as
ineffably sweet as that of healthful babes, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
ladies sweltered and rolled and tossed with discomfort
in the moist heat that had accumulated in the closed
rooms.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><span class="smcap">Asleep, Early Morning, on the Painted
Desert.</span></p>

<p>A few years later I was again at Oraibi, and
strangely near the same camping place. This time my
companions were W. W. Bass, whose early adventures
have been recounted in my "In and Around the Grand
Canyon," a photographer, and a British friend of his who
had stopped off in California on his way home from
Japan. Mr. Britisher had contributed a small share
towards the expenses of the expedition, but with insular
ignorance he had presumed that his small mite would
pay the expenses of the whole outfit for a long period.
It must be confessed that we had had a most arduous
trip. The Painted Desert had shown its ugly side from
the very moment we left the railway. Four miles out
we had been stopped by the most terrific and vivid
lightning-storm it has ever been my good fortune to
witness and to be scared half out of my wits with. At
Rock Tanks we had another storm. We had been
jolted and shaken on our way out to Hopi Point of the
Grand Canyon, and had come so near to perishing for
want of water that we fell on our knees and greedily
drank the vilest liquid from an alkali pool, a standing
place of horses, on our way to the Little Colorado. At
the old Tanner Crossing of that stream we had had another
rain and lightning-storm near unto the first in fury, and
in which our British friend had been caught in his
blankets and nearly frightened to death. In the Moenkopi
Wash he was offended because I left the wagon
to ride to the home and accept the hospitality of the
Mormon bishop, which he interpreted again with insular
ignorance to mean a palace, a place of luxury, exquisite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
restfulness, good foods, and delicious iced wines, while
he was left to beans, bacon, flapjacks, and dried fruit,
and a roll of blankets on the rough and uneven ground.
(It didn't make any difference that I explained to him
next day that I had slept on a grass plot with one quilt
and no pillow, cold, shivering, and longing for my good
substantial roll of Navaho blankets, left for him to use
if he so desired, and that our "banquet" had been coarse
bread and a bowl of milk.) Then we had had another
storm at Toh-gas-je, which I had partially avoided by
riding on ahead in the light wagon of the Indian agent
who piloted us, while he&mdash;Mr. Britisher&mdash;was in the
heavier ambulance. The next night we camped, attempting
to sleep on the stony slopes of the hillside at
Blue Canyon in wretchedness and misery, because it
was too late when we arrived to dare to drive down into
the canyon. The next day we drove over the Sahara
of America, a sandy desert which even to the Hopis is
the most a-tu-u-u (hot) of all earthly places. That
noon we camped in the dry wash of Tnebitoh, where we
had to dig for water, waiting for it slowly to seep into
the hole we had dug. It was a sandy, alkaline decoction,
but we were glad and thankful for it, and the way
the poor horses stood and longingly looked on as we
waited for the inflow was pitiable. At night we camped
some twelve or fifteen miles farther on, without water,
hobbling the horses and turning them loose. I had
engaged an Indian to go with us from Blue Canyon as
helper and guide, so I sent him, in the morning, to
bring in the horses. Two or three hours later he returned,
with but one of the animals, and said he had
tried to track the others, but could not do so. Imagine
what our predicament would have been, in the heart of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the desert, without horses and water, and many miles
away from any settlement. There was but one thing
to be done, and Mr. Bass at once did it. Putting a
bridle on the one horse, he rode off barebacked after
the runaways. Knowing the character of his mules, he
aimed directly for the Tnebitoh. When he arrived at the
spot where we had watered the day before, he found
that, with unerring instinct, the horses had returned to
this spot and had dug new watering places for themselves.
Then, scenting the cool grass of the San
Francisco Mountains, they had aimed directly west, and,
hobbled though they were, the tracks showed they were
travelling at a lively rate of speed. Knowing the urgency
and desperateness of our case, Bass followed as
fast as he could make his almost exhausted animal go,
and after an hour's hard riding saw, in the far-away
distance, the three perverse creatures "hitting" the
trailless desert as hard as they could. Jersey, a knowing
mule, was in the lead. He soon saw Bass, and,
seeming to communicate with the others, they turned
and saw him also. Jack (the other mule) and the
horse at once showed a disposition to stop, but Jersey
with bite and whinney tried to drive them on. Finding
his efforts useless, he stopped with the others, and, when
Bass rode up, allowed himself to be "necked" (tied neck
to neck) with the other two. Horses and man were as
near "played out" as we cared to see them when, later
in the day, they returned to camp.</p>

<p>It does not do to go out upon the Painted Desert
without some practical person who is capable of meeting
all serious emergencies that are likely to arise.</p>

<p>The next day we drove on to Oraibi, in the scorching
sun, over the sandy hillocks, where no road would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
last an hour in a wind-storm unless it were thoroughly
blanketed and pegged down. We were all hot, weary,
and ill-tempered. Thinking to help out, I volunteered
to walk up the steep western trail to the mesa top and
secure some corn at Oraibi for our horses, so that they
could be fed at once on reaching our stopping place on
the east side. When we started I had suggested the
hope that we might be able to stop in the schoolhouse
below the Oraibi mesa, as I had several times done in
times before; but when the wagon arrived there, and
I came down from the mesa, it was found to be already
occupied by persons to whom it had been promised by
the Indian agent. Camping, then, was the only thing left
open to us, until I could see the Hopis and rent one of
their houses. Down we drove to the camp, where alone
a sufficiency of water was to be found. This explains
our close proximity to the camp of the earlier year.
We were just preparing our meal when a fierce sand-storm
blew up. Cooking was out of the question; the
fire blew every which way, and the sand filled meat,
beans, corn, tomatoes with too much grit for comfort.
This was the last straw that broke the back of Mr.
Britisher's complacency. He had bemoaned again and
again the leaving of his comfortable home to come into
this "God-forsaken region," in a quest of what our crazy
westernism called pleasure, and now his fury burst upon
me in a manner that dwarfed the passion of the heavens
and the earth. While there was a refinement in his
vituperation, there was an edge upon it as keen as fury,
passion, and culture could give it. I was scorched by
his scarifying lightnings, struck again and again by his
vindictive thunderbolts, tossed hither and thither by
his stormy winds, and lifted heavenwards and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
dashed downwards by the tornadoes and whirlwinds
of his passion. It was dazzling, bewildering, intensely
interesting, and then fiercely irritating. I stood it all
until he denounced my selfishness. There's no doubt
I am selfish, but there is a limit to a fellow's endurance
when another fellow claims the discovery and rubs it in
upon you until he abrades the skin. So I raised my
hand and also my voice: "Stop, that's enough. Dare
to repeat that and I'll tie you on a horse and send you
back to the railway in charge of an Indian so quickly
that you'll wonder how you got there. Selfish, am I?
I permitted you to come on this trip as a favor to my
photographer. The paltry sum you paid me has not
found one-fourth share of the corn for one horse,
let alone your own food, the hire of the horses, wagon,
and driver. To oblige you I have allowed you the whole
way to ride inside my conveyance that you might talk
together, while I have sat out in the hot sun. If any
help has been needed by Mr. Bass in driving, I have
willingly given it instead of calling upon you. I have
done all the unpacking and the packing of the wagon
at each camp, morning, noon, and night. I have done
all the cooking and much of the dish-washing, and yet
you have the impudence and mendacity to say I have
been selfish. Very well! I'll take myself at your
estimate. In future I'll take my seat inside the ambulance;
you shall do your share of helping the driver.
You shall do your share of the packing; and if you eat
another mouthful, so long as you remain in my camp,
you shall cook it yourself. I have spoken! And when
I thus speak I speak as the laws of the Medes and
Persians, which alter not, nor change!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, &mdash;&mdash; says you are selfish!" burst out the somewhat
cowed man.</p>

<p>"Then I put him on the same plane as I put you;
and if ever either of you dares to make that charge
again, I will&mdash;"</p>

<p>Well, never mind what I, in my, what I still believe
to be, just anger threatened. I turned away, went and
secured an Indian's house, and that night we removed
there.</p>

<p>But I wish I had the space to recount how those two
unfortunates and misfortunates cooked their own meals
and mine and Bass's. It is a subject fit for a Dickens
or a Kipling. No minor pen can do justice to it. How
they came and asked with quiet humility, "What are
we going to have for supper?" and how I replied,
"Raw potatoes, so far as I am concerned!" Neither
knew whether a frying-pan was for skimming cream
from a can of condensed milk or for making charlotte
russes. Neither could boil water without scorching it.
But surreptitiously (with my secret connivance) Bass
gave the tyros gentle hints and finally "licked them"
into fourth-rate cooks, so that I reaped the reward of
their labors in selfishly and shamelessly taking some
of the concoctions they had slaved over.</p>

<p>I know this plain, unvarnished tale reveals me a "bad
man from Bodie," but I started out to give a truthful
account of the Painted Desert and its storms, and this
"tempest in a frying-pan" in camp cannot well be ignored
by a veracious chronicler.</p>

<p>Last year, fate designed that we camp at exactly the
same spot. The two wagons came to rest at about
the same place where the ambulance stood, and exactly
the same wind and sand-storm blew up before we had
been there half an hour. I had with me a long,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
eight-feet-high strip of canvas belonging to a very large
circular tent. To ward off the force of some part of
the storm we stretched this canvas from the trunk of
one cottonwood tree to another, and moved our camp
to the sheltered side. That was an insult to the powers
of the storm. The wind fairly howled with rage, and
pulled and tugged and flapped that canvas in a perfect
fury of anger. Then as we huddled in its shelter, a
sudden jerk came, and up it was ripped, from top to
bottom, in a moment, and the loose ends went wildly
flying and flapping every way. In the blowing sand I
fled with the ladies to Mr. Voth's ever-hospitable house,
but it was as hot as&mdash;well! no matter&mdash;in there.
Outside, the cottonwoods were bowed over in the fury
of the wind, and the sand went flying by in sheets. It
was easy then to understand the remark of one experienced
in the ways of the Painted Desert Region: "If
you ever buy any real estate here, contract to have it
anchored, or you'll wake up some morning and find
it all blown into the next county." The flying sand
literally obliterated every object more than a few feet
away.</p>

<p>Now in this last case I had the pleasure&mdash;as peculiar
a pleasure as it is to watch the coming of a hurricane
at sea&mdash;to see the oncoming of this storm. We were
enjoying perfect calm. Suddenly over the Oraibi mesa
there came a great brown mass that stretched entirely
across the country. It was the tawny sand risen in
power and majesty to drive us from its lair. It was so
grand, so sublime, so alive, that just as I instinctively
rush to my camera at sight of an interesting face, I
dashed towards it to secure a photograph of this new,
gigantic, living manifestation. But in its fierce fury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
it swept upon us with such rapidity that I was too late.
We were covered with it, buried in it. As darkness
leaps upon one and absorbs him, so did this storm
absorb us. In an hour or so its greatest fury subsided;
then we thought we would build our camp-fire and
proceed to our regular cooking. How the wind veered
and changed, and changed again as soon as the fire began
to ascend. That is a point to watch in building a camp-fire.
Be sure and locate it so that its smoke won't
blow upon you when you sit down to eat. In this case,
however, it would not have mattered. In my notebook
I read: "We have changed the camp-fire three
times, and no matter where we put it, the smoke swoops
down upon us. Even now while I write I am half
blinded by the smoke, which ten minutes ago was being
blown in the opposite direction." So that if these few
pages have an unpleasant odor of camp-fire smoke
about them, the reader must charge it to the wilful
ways of the wind on the Painted Desert.</p>

<p>Elsewhere I have spoken of the mystery brooding
over the peoples of this land. It is also existent in the
very colors of it, whether noted in early morning, in
the glare of the pitiless Arizona noon, or at sunset; in the
storm, with the air full of sand, or in the calm and quiet
of a cloudless sky; when the sky is cerulean or black
with lowering clouds; ever, always, the color is weird,
strange, mysterious. One night at Walpi several of
us sat and watched the colorings in the west. No
unacquainted soul would have believed such could
exist. To describe it is as impossible as to analyze
the feelings of love. It was raining everywhere in the
west; and "everywhere" means so much where one's
horizon is not limited. The eye there roams over what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
seem to be boundless distances. In all this space rain
was falling. The sun had but half an hour more to live,
and it flooded the sky with an orange crimson. The
rain came down in hairy streaks brilliantly illuminated.
The sun could be discerned only as a dimly veiled
face, with the light shed below it&mdash;none above&mdash;in
graceful curves. Then the orange and crimson changed
to purple, deepening and deepening into blackness until
day was done.</p>

<p>Sometimes the lighting up of the desert in the early
morning gives it the effect of a sea-green ocean, and
then the illusion is indescribably wonderful. At such
times, if there are clouds in the sky, the reflections of
color are as delicate and beautiful as the tintings of the
sea-shells.</p>

<p>One night standing on the mesa at Mashonganavi
looking east and south, the vast ocean-like expanse
of tawny sand and desert was converted by the hues of
dying day into a gorgeous and resplendent sea of exquisite
and delicate color. On the further side were
the Mogollon Buttes,&mdash;the Giant's Chair, Pyramid
Butte, and others,&mdash;with long walls, which, in the early
morning black and forbidding, were now illumined and
etherealized by the magic wand of sunset.</p>

<p>If, however, one would know another of the marvellous
charms of this Painted Desert Region let him see
it in the early summer, after the first rains. This may
be the latter part of June or in July and August. Then
what a change! One seeing it for the first time would
naturally exclaim in protest: "Desert? Why, this is
a garden!"</p>

<p>A thin and sparse covering of grass, but enough to
the casual observer to relieve the whole land from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the charge of barrenness; the black and white grama
grasses, with their delicate shades of green; and a host
of wild flowers of most exquisite colors in glorious combinations.
Here masses of flaming marigolds and sunflowers;
yonder patches of the white and purple tinted
flowers of the jimson-weed, while its rich green leaves
form a complete covering for the tawny sand or rocky
desolation beneath. Here are larkspurs, baby blue-eyes,
Indian's paint brush, daisies, lilies, and a thousand and
one others, the purples, blues, reds, pinks, whites, and
browns giving one a chromatic feast, none the less
delightful because it is totally unexpected.</p>

<p>Then who can tell of the glory of the hundreds of
cacti in bloom, great prickly monsters, barrel shaped,
cylindrical, lobe formed, and yet all picked out in the
rarest, most dainty flowers the eye of man ever gazed
upon? Look yonder at the "hosh-kon," one of the
yucca family, a sacred plant to the Navahoes. Its
dagger-like green leaves are crowned and glorified with
the central stalk, around which cluster a thousand waxen
white bells, and this one is only a beginning to the marvellous
display of them we shall see as we ride along.
The greasewood veils its normal ugliness in revivified
leaves and a delicate flossy yellow bloom that
makes it charming to the eye. Even the sagebrush
attains to some charm of greenness, and where the juniper
and cedar and pine lurk in the shades of some of the
rocky slopes, the deepest green adds its never-ending
comfort and delight to the scene.</p>

<p>Yet you look in vain for the rivers, the creeks, the
babbling brooks, the bubbling fountains, the ponds, that
charm your eye in Eastern landscapes. Oh, for the
Adirondacks,&mdash;the lakes and streams which abound on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
every hand. If only these could be transplanted into
this desert to give their peculiar delights without any
of their drawbacks, <i>then</i> the Painted Desert Region
would be the ideal land.</p>

<p>It would never do to bring the Adirondack flies and
gnats and mosquitoes; its hot, sultry nights and muggy,
sweltering days. No! These we can do without.
We would have its advantages, but with none of its
disadvantages.</p>

<p>How futile such wishes; how childish such longings!
Each place is itself; and, for myself, I love the Painted
Desert even in its waterlessness, its barrenness, and its
desolation. Think of its stimulating altitude, its colors,
its clear, cloudless sky, its glorious, divine stars, its
delicious evening coolness, its never-disturbed solitudes,
its speaking silences, its romances, its mysteries, its
tragedies, its histories. These are some of the things
that make the Painted Desert what it is&mdash;a region of
unqualified fascination and allurement.</p>

<h2><a name="ChIII." id="ChIII."></a>CHAPTER III<br />
<small>FIRST GLIMPSES OF THE HOPI</small></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">hree</span> great fingers of rock from a gigantic and
misshapen hand, roughly speaking, pointing southward,
the hand a great plateau, the fingers mesas of
solid rock thrust into the heart of a sandy valley,&mdash;this
is the home of the Hopi, commonly and wrongly
termed the Moki. The fingers are from seven to ten
miles apart, and a visitor can go from one finger-nail to
another either by descending and ascending the steep
trails zigzagged on the fingers' sides, or he can circle
around on the back of the hand and thus in a round-about
manner reach any one of the three fingers. These
mesa fingers are generally spoken of as the first or
east mesa, the second or middle mesa, and the third
or west mesa. They gain their order from the fact
that in the early days of American occupancy Mr.
T. V. Keam established a trading-post in the canyon
that bears his name, and this canyon being to the east
of the eastern mesa, this mesa was reached first in
order, the western mesa naturally being third.</p>

<p>On the east mesa are three villages. The most important
of all Hopi towns is Walpi, which occupies the
"nail" of this first "finger." It is not so large as
Oraibi, but it has always held a commanding influence,
which it still retains. Half a mile back of Walpi is
Sichumavi, and still further back Hano, or, as it is
commonly and incorrectly called, Tewa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>About seven miles&mdash;as the crow flies&mdash;to the west is
the second or middle mesa, and here are Mashonganavi,
Shipauluvi, and on an offshoot from this second mesa,
separated from it by a deep, sand-filled ravine, is
Shungopavi.</p>

<p>Ten miles farther to the west is Oraibi, which marks
the farthest western boundary of pueblo civilization.</p>

<p>Oh! the pathos, the woe, the untold but clearly
written misery of the centuries in these cliff-built houses
of the mesas, these residences that are fortresses, these
steep trail-approached and precipice-protected homes.
In a desert land, surrounded by relentless, wary, and
vigilant foes, ever fighting a hard battle with the
adverse conditions of their environment, short of
water, of firewood, and with food grown in the
desert-rescued lands below where at any moment the ruthless
marauder might appear, there is no wonder that almost
every elderly face is seamed and scarred; furrowed
deeply with the accumulated centuries of never-ceasing
care. Mystery here seems at first to reign supreme.
It stands and faces one as a Presence. It hovers and
broods, and you feel it even in your sleep. The air is
full of it. The very clouds here are mysterious. Who
are these people? From whence came they? What is
their destiny? What fearful battles, race hatreds,
devastating wars, led them to make their homes on these
inaccessible cliffs? How did they ever conceive such a
mass of elaborate ceremonial as now controls them?
Solitary and alone they appear, a vast question mark,
viewed from every standpoint. Whichever way one
looks at them a great query stares him in the face.
They are the chief mystery of our country, an anachronism,
an anomaly in our twentieth-century civilization.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>When we see the ruins of Egypt, India, Assyria, we
look upon something that is past. Those peoples <i>were</i>:
they pertain to the ages that are gone. Their mysteries
are of lives lived in the dim ages of antiquity. But
here are antique lives being lived in our own day;
pieces of century-old civilizations transplanted, in time
and place, and brought into our time and place; the
past existent in the present; the lapse of centuries
forgotten, and the days of thousands of years ago bodily
transferred into our commercial, super-cultured,
hyper-refined age.</p>

<p>The approach to the first mesa from Keam's Canyon
is through a sandy country, which, in places, is dry,
desolate, and bare. But here and there are patches of
ground upon which weeds grow to a great height,
plainly indicating that with cultivation and irrigation
good crops could be raised. As we leave the mouth
of the canyon the singular character of this plateau
province is revealed. To the south the sandy desert,
in lonesome desolation, stretches away as far as the
eye can reach, its wearisome monotony relieved only
by the close-by corn-fields of the Hopis and the peculiar
buttes of the Mogollons. With the sun blazing down
upon it, its forbidding barrenness is appalling. Neither
tree, shrub, blade of grass, animal, or human habitation
is to be seen. The sand reflects the sun's rays in a
yellow glare which is irritating beyond measure, and
which seems as if it would produce insanity by its
unchangeableness.</p>

<p>To the right of us are the extremities of the sandstone
plateaus, of which the Hopi mesas are the thrust out
fingers. Here and there are breaks in the plateau
which seem like openings into rocky canyons. Before
us, ten or more miles away, is the long wall of the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
mesa, its falling precipices red and glaring in the sun.
Immense rocks of irregular shape lie about on its
summit as if tumbled to and fro in some long-ago-forgotten
frolic of prehistoric giants. Right before us,
and at about the mid distances of the "finger" from
the main plateau, the mesa wall is broken down in the
form of a U-shaped notch or gap,&mdash;from which Walpi,
"the place of the gap," obtains its name; and it is on
the extremity of the mesa, beyond this notch, that the
houses of the Hopi towns can now clearly be discerned.
Just beyond the notch a little heap of houses, apparently
of the same color as the mesa itself, appears. Then a
little vacant space and another small heap, followed by
another vacancy with a larger heap at the extreme
end of the mesa. These heaps, beginning at the notch,
are respectively Tewa, Sichumavi, and Walpi.</p>

<p>Dotting the slopes of the talus at the foot of the
mesa precipices are corn-fields, peach orchards, and
corrals for burros, sheep, and goats.</p>

<p>As we approach nearer we see that the first mesa
is rapidly losing its distinctively Indian character. The
policy of the United States Government, in its treatment
of these Indians, is to induce them, so far as possible,
to leave their mesa homes and reside in the valley
nearer to their corn-fields. As their enemies are no
longer allowed to molest them, their community life
on these mesa heights is no longer necessary, and the
time lost and the energy wasted in climbing up and
down the steep trails could far better be employed in
working in the fields, caring for their orchards, or
attending to their stock. But while all this sounds
well in theory, and on paper appears perfectly reasonable,
it fails to take into consideration the influence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
heredity and the personal passions, desires, and feelings
of volitional beings. As a result, the government plan
is not altogether a success. The Indian agents, however,
have induced certain of the Hopis, by building
houses for them, to consent to a partial abandonment
of their mesa homes. Accordingly, as one draws
nearer, he sees the stone houses with their red-painted
corrugated-iron roofs, the schoolhouse, the blacksmith's
shop, and the houses of the teachers, all of which speak
significantly of the change that is slowly hovering over
the Indian's dream of solitude and desolation.</p>

<p>But after our camp is made and the horses sent out
in the care of willing Indians to the Hopi pastures, we
find that the trails to the mesa summit are the same;
the glaring yellow sand is the same; the red and gray
rocks are the same; the fleecy and dark clouds that
occasionally appear at this the rainy time are the
same; the glaring, pitiless sun with its infernal scorching
is the same; and we respire and perspire and
pant and struggle in our climb to the summit in the
same old arduous fashion. Above, in Hano, Sichumavi,
and Walpi, the pot-bellied, naked children, the lithe and
active young men, the not unattractive, shapely, and
kindly-faced young women, with their peculiar symbolic
style of hair-dressing, the blear-eyed old men
and women, the patient and stolid burros, the dim-eyed
and pathetic captive eagles, the quaint terraced-houses
with their peculiar ladders, grotesque chimneys, passageways,
and funny little steps, are practically the same as
they have been for centuries.</p>

<p>There are two trails from the valley to the summit
of the first mesa on the east side, one at the point, and
three on the west side. We ascend by the northeastern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
trail, which, on reaching the "Notch" or "Gap," winds
close by an enclosure in which is found a large fossil,
bearing a rude resemblance to a stone snake. All
around this fossil, within the stone enclosure, are to
be found "bahos," or prayer sticks, which have been
brought by the devout as their offerings to the Snake
Divinities. From time immemorial this shrine has
been in existence, and no Hopi ever passes it without
some offering to "Those Above," either in the form
of a baho, a sprinkling of the sacred meal, the ceremonial
smoking to the six cardinal points, or a few
words of silent but none the less devout and earnest
prayer.</p>

<p>At the head of this trail is Hano, and from this pueblo
we can gain a general idea of Hopi architecture, for,
with differences in minor details, the general styles are
practically the same. Where they gained their architectural
knowledge it is hard to tell, and who they are
is yet an unsolved problem. It is pretty generally conceded,
however, that all the pueblo peoples of Arizona
and New Mexico&mdash;of whom the Hopis are the most
western&mdash;are the descendants of the race, or races,
who dotted these territories and southern Colorado
with ruins, and who are commonly known as the Cliff
and Cave Dwellers. But this is thrusting the difficulty
only a few generations, or scores of generations,
further back. For we are at once compelled to the
agnostic answer, "I don't know!" when asked who are
the Cliff Dwellers. Who they are and whence they
came are still problems upon which such patient
investigators as J. Walter Fewkes is working. He has
clearly confirmed the decision of Bancroft and others
which affirmed the identity of the Cliff and Cave Dwellers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
with the Hopis and other pueblo-inhabiting Indians
of the Southwest.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="hano">
<img class="border" style="margin-top: 1em;" src="images/image9.jpg" width="600" height="386" alt="Hano, (Tewa) from the Head of the Trail." />
</a></div>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span class="smcap">Hano, (Tewa) from the Head of the Trail.</span></p>

<p>Although of different linguistic stocks and religion,
the homes of the pueblo Indians are very similar. Almost
without exception the pueblos built on mesa
summits are of sandstone or other rock, plastered
with adobe mud brought up from the water-courses
of the valley. Those pueblos that are located in the
valley, on the other hand, are generally built of
adobe.</p>

<p>No one can doubt that the Indians chose these elevated
mesa sites for purposes of protection. With
but one or two almost inaccessible trails reaching the
heights, and these easily defendable, their homes were
their fortresses. Their fields, gardens, and
hunting-grounds were in the valleys or far-away mountains,
whither they could go in times of peace; but, when
attacked by foes, they fled up the trails, established
elaborate methods of defence, and remained in their
fortress-homes until the danger was past.</p>

<p>The very construction of the houses reveals this. In
none of the older houses is there any doorway into
the lowest story. A solid wall faces the visitor, with
perhaps a small window-hole. A rude ladder outside
and a similar one inside afford the only means of
entrance. One climbs up the ladder outside, drops
through a hole in the roof, and descends the ladder
inside. When attacked, the outer ladder could be
drawn up, and thus, if we remember the crude weapons
of the aborigines when discovered by the white man, it
is evident that the inhabitants would remain in
comparative security.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Of late years doors and windows have been introduced
into many of the ancient houses.</p>

<p>It is a picturesque sight that the visitor to the Hopi
towns enjoys as he reaches the head of the trail at
Hano. The houses are built in terraces, two or three
stories high, the second story being a step back from
the first, so that a portion of the roof of the first story
can be used as the courtyard or children's playground
of the people who inhabit the second story. The third
story recedes still farther, so that its people have a front
yard on the roof of the second story. At Zuni and
Taos these terraces continue for six and seven stories,
but with the Hopis never exceed three. The first climb
is generally made on a ladder, which rests in the street
below. The ladder-poles, however, are much longer than
is necessary, and they reach up indefinitely towards
the sky. Sometimes a ladder is used to go from the
second to the third story, but more often a quaint little
stairway is built on the connecting walls. Equally
quaint are the ollas used as chimneys. These have
their bottoms knocked out, and are piled one above
another, two, three, four, and sometimes five or six high.
Some of the "terraces" are partially enclosed, and here
one may see a weaver's loom, a flat stone for cooking
<i>piki</i> (wafer bread), or a beehive-like oven used for general
cooking purposes. Here and there cord-wood is
piled up for future use, and now and again a captive
eagle, fastened with a rawhide tether to the bars of a
rude cage, may be seen. The "king of birds" is highly
prized for his down and feathers, which are used for the
making of prayer plumes (bahos).</p>

<p>There does not seem to have been much planning in
the original construction of the Hopi pueblos. There
was little or no provision made for the future. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
first houses were built as needed, and then as occasion
demanded other rooms were added.</p>

<p>It will doubtless be surprising to some readers to
learn that the Hopi houses are owned and <i>built</i> (in the
main) by the women, and that the men weave the
women's garments and knit their own stockings. Here,
too, the women enjoy other "rights" that their white
sisters have long fought for. The home life of the
Hopis is based upon the rights of women. They own
the houses; the wife receives her newly married husband
into her home; the children belong to her clan,
and have her clan name, and not that of the father; the
corn, melons, squash, and other vegetables belong to
her when once deposited in her house by the husband.
She, indeed, is the queen of her own home, hence the
pueblo Indian woman occupies a social relationship
different from that of most aborigines, in that she is on
quite equal terms with her husband.</p>

<p>In the actual building of the houses, however, the
husband is required to perform his share, and that is
the most arduous part of the labor. He goes with
his burros to the wooded mesas or cottonwood-lined
streams and brings the roof-timbers, ladder-poles, and
door-posts. He also brings the heavier rocks needed
in the building. Then the women aid him in placing
the heavier objects, after which he leaves them to their
own devices.</p>

<p>Being an intensely religious people, the shamans or
priests are always called upon when a new house is to
be constructed. Bahos&mdash;prayer plumes or sticks&mdash;are
placed in certain places, sacred meal is lavishly sprinkled,
and singing and prayer offered, all as propitiation to
those gods whose especial business it is to care for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
houses.</p>

<p>It is exceedingly interesting to see the women at
work. Without plumb-line, straight line, or trowel they
proceed. Some women are hod-carriers, bringing the
pieces of sand or limestone rock to the "bricklayers"
in baskets, buckets, or dish pans. Others mix the adobe
to the proper consistency and see that the workers are
kept supplied with it. And what a laughing, chattering,
jabbering group it is! Every tongue seems to be going,
and no one listening. Once at Oraibi I saw twenty-three
women engaged in the building of a house, and I
then got a new "side light" on the story of the Tower
of Babel; The builders of that historic structure were
women, and the confusion of tongues was the natural
result of their feminine determination to all speak at
once and never listen to any one else.</p>

<p>I photographed the builders at Oraibi, and the next
day contributed a new dress to each of the twenty-three
workers. Here are some of their names: Wa-ya-wei-i-ni-ma,
Mo-o-ho, Ha-hei-i, So-li, Ni-vai-un-si, Si-ka-ho-in-ni-ma,
Na-i-so-wa, Ma-san-i-yam-ka, Ko-hoi-ko-cha,
Tang-a-ka-win-ka, Hun-o-wi-ti, Ko-mai-a-ni-ma, Ke-li-an-i-ma.</p>

<p>The finishing of the house is as interesting as the
actual building. With a small heap of adobe mud the
woman, using her hand as a trowel, fills in the chinks,
smooths and plasters the walls inside and out. Splashed
from head to foot with mud, she is an object to behold,
and, as is often the case, if her children are there to
"help" her, no mud-larks on the North River, the
Missouri, or the Thames ever looked more happy in
their complete abandonment to dirt than they. Then
when the whitewashing is done with gypsum, or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
coloring of the walls with a brown wash, what fun the
children have. No pinto pony was ever more speckled
and variegated than they as they splash their tiny hands
into the coloring matter and dash it upon the walls.</p>

<p>Inside the houses the walls also are whitewashed
or colored, and generally there is some attempt made
to decorate them by painting rude though symbolic
designs half-way between the floor and ceiling. The
floor is of earth, well packed down with water generally
mixed with plaster, and the ceiling is of the sustaining
poles and cross-beams, over which willows and earth
have been placed. Invariably one can find feathered
bahos, or prayer plumes, in the beams above, and no
house could expect to be prospered where these offerings
to "Those Above" were neglected.</p>

<p>The chief family room serves as kitchen, dining-room,
corn-grinding-room, bedroom, parlor, and reception-room.
In one corner a quaint, hooded fireplace is
built, and here the housewife cooks her <i>piki</i> and other
corn foods, boils or bakes her squash, roasts, broils, or
boils the little meat she is able to secure, and sits during
the winter nights while "the elders" tell stories of the
wondrous past, when all the animals talked like human
beings and the mysterious people&mdash;the gods&mdash;from
the upper world came down to earth and associated with
mankind.</p>

<p>The corn-grinding trough is never absent. Sometimes
it is on a little raised platform, and is large or
small as the size of the family demands. The trough is
composed either of wooden or stone slabs, cemented
into the floor and securely fastened at the corners with
rawhide thongs. This trough is then divided into two,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
three, four, or more compartments (according to its
size), and in each compartment a sloping slab of basic
rock is placed. Kneeling behind this, the woman who
is the grinder of the meal (the true lady, <i>laf-dig</i>, even
though a Hopi) seizes in both hands a narrower flat
piece of the same kind of rock, and this, with the motion
of a woman over a washboard, she moves up and down,
throwing a handful of corn every few strokes on the
upper side of her grinder. This is arduous work, and
yet I have known the women and maidens to keep
steadily at it during the entire day.</p>

<p>When the meal is ground, a small fire is made of corn
cobs, over which an earthern olla is placed. When this
is sufficiently heated the meal is stirred about in it by
means of a round wicker basket, to keep it from burning.
This process partially cooks the meal, so that it is
more easily prepared into food when needed.</p>

<p>In one corner of the house several large ollas will be
found full of water. Living as they do on these mesa
heights, where there are no springs, water is scarce and
precious. Every drop, except the little that is caught
in rain-time or melted from the snows, has to be carried
up on the backs of the women from the valley below.
In the heat of summer, this is no light task. With the
fierce Arizona sun beating down upon them, the feet
slipping in the hot sand or wearily pressing up on the
burning rocks, the olla, filled with water, wrapped in a
blanket and suspended from the forehead on the back,
becomes heavier and heavier at each step. Those of us
who have, perforce, carried cameras and heavy plates to
the mesa tops know what strength and endurance this
work requires.</p>

<p>For dippers home-made pottery and gourd shells are
commonly used. Now and again one will find the horn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
of a mountain sheep, which has been heated, opened
out into a large spoon-like dipper; or a gnarled or knotty
piece of wood, hacked out with flint knife into a pretty
good resemblance to a dipper.</p>

<p>Near the water ollas one can generally see a shelf
upon which the household utensils are placed. Here,
too, when corn is being ground, a half-dozen plaques
of meal will stand. This shelf serves as pantry and
meat safe (when there is meat), and the hungry visitor
will seldom look there in vain for a basket-platter or
two piled high with <i>piki</i>, the fine wafer bread for which
the Hopis are noted. <i>Piki</i> is colored in a variety of
ways. Dr. Hough says the ashes of <i>Atriplex canescens
James</i> are used to give the gray color, and that <i>Amaranthus
sp.</i> is cultivated in terrace gardens around the
springs for use in dyeing it red; a special red dye from
another species is used for coloring the <i>piki</i> used in the
Katchina dances; and the ashes of <i>Parryella filifolia</i>
are used for coloring. Saffron (<i>Carthamus tinctorius</i>)
is used to give the yellow color.</p>

<p>It is fascinating in the extreme to see a woman make
<i>piki</i>. Dry corn-meal is mixed with coloring matter and
water, and thus converted into a soft batter. A large,
flat stone is so placed on stones that a fire can be kept
continually burning underneath it. As soon as the slab
is as hot as an iron must be to iron starched clothes it is
greased with mutton tallow. Then with fingers dipped
in the batter the woman dexterously and rapidly sweeps
them over the surface of the hot stone. Almost as
quickly as the batter touches, it is cooked; so to cover
the whole stone and yet make even and smooth <i>piki</i> requires
skill. It looks so easy that I have known many
a white woman (and man) tempted into trying to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
it. Once while attending the Snake Dance ceremonials
at Mashonganavi, a young lady member of my party
was sure she could perform the operation successfully.
My Hopi friend, Kuchyeampsi, gladly gave place to the
white lady, and laughingly looked at me as the latter
dipped her fingers into the batter, swept them over the
stone, gave a suppressed exclamation of pain, tried
again, and then hastily rose with three fingers well
blistered. My cook, who was a white man, was sure he
could accomplish the operation, so he was allowed to
try. Once was enough. He was a religious man, and
bravely kept silence, which was a good thing for us.</p>

<p>When the <i>piki</i> is sufficiently cooked, it is folded up
into neat little shapes something like the shredded wheat
biscuits. One thing I have often noticed is that a quick
and skilful <i>piki</i> maker will keep a sheet flat, without
folding, so that she may place it over the next sheet
when it is about cooked. This seems to make it easier
to remove the newly cooked sheet from the cooking
slab.</p>

<p>If you are ever invited into a Hopi house you may
rest assured you will not be there long before a piled-up
basket of <i>piki</i> will be brought to you, for the Hopis
are wonderfully hospitable and enjoy giving to all who
become their guests.</p>

<p>Another object seldom absent is the "pole of the soft
stuff." This is a pole suspended from the roof beams
upon which all the blankets, skins, bedding, and wearing
apparel are placed. Once upon a time these were
very few and very crude. The skins of animals tanned
with the hair on, blankets made of rabbit skins, and
cotton garments made from home grown, spun, and
woven cotton, comprised their "soft stuff." But when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the Spaniards brought sheep into the province of
Tusayan, and the Hopis saw the wonderful improvement
a wool staple was over a cotton one, blankets and
dresses of wool were slowly added to the household
treasures, until now the "garments of the old," except
antelope, deer, fox, and coyote skins, are seldom seen.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>It is a remarkable fact that the Hopis wore garments
made from cotton which they grew themselves, prior to
the time of the Spanish invasion. They also knew how
to color the cotton from unfading mineral and vegetable
dyes, and in the graves of ancient cliff and cave dwellings,
well-woven cotton garments often have been taken.</p>

<p>Sometimes to-day one may see an old man or woman
weaving a blanket from the tanned skins of rabbits.
Such a garment is far warmer and more comfortable
than one would imagine. The dressed pelts are twisted
around a home-woven string made of shredded yucca
fibre, wild flax, or cotton, and thus a long rope is formed
many yards in length. This rope is then woven in
parallel strings with cross strands of the same kind of
fibre, and a robe made some five or six feet square.</p>

<p>The windows of the ancient Hopi houses were either
small open holes or sheets of gypsum. Of late years
modern doors and windows have been introduced, yet
there are still many of the old ones in existence.</p>

<p>Having thus taken a general and cursory survey of
Hano, let us, in turn, visit the six other villages on the
mesa heights ere we look further into the social and
ceremonial life of this interesting people.</p>

<h2><a name="ChIV." id="ChIV."></a>CHAPTER IV<br />
<small>THE HOPI VILLAGES AND THEIR HISTORY</small></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> province of Tusayan is dotted over in every
direction with ruins, all of which were once inhabited
by the Hopi people. Indeed, even in the
"pueblo" stage of their existence they seem to have
retained much of the restlessness and desire for change
which marked them when "nomads."</p>

<p>Traditionary lore among modern Hopis asserts that the
well-known ruin of Casa Grande was once the home of
their ancestors, and Dr. Fewkes has conclusively shown
a line of ruins extending from the Gila and Salt River
valleys to the present Hopi villages. So there is no
doubt but that some, at least, of the Hopis came to
their modern homes from the South. It is, therefore,
quite possible that such ruins as Montezuma's Castle
were once Hopi homes. Every indication seems to point
to the fact that all these ancient ruins&mdash;some of which
are caveate, others cliff, and still others independent
pueblos, built in the open, away from all cliffs&mdash;were
occupied by a people in dread of attack from enemies.
Every home has its lookout. Every field could be
watched. Nearly all the cliff and cave dwellings were
naturally fortresses, and the open pueblos were so
constructed as to render them castles of defence to their
inhabitants on occasion.</p>

<p>In these facts alone we can see an interesting, though
to those primarily concerned a tragic state of affairs;
a home-loving people, sedentary and agricultural, willing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and anxious to live at peace, surrounded and
perpetually harassed by wild and fierce nomads, whose
delight was war, their occupation pillage, and their chief
gratifications murder and rapine. The cliff- or
cave-dwelling husband left his home in the morning to plant
his corn or irrigate his field, uncertain whether the
night would see him safe again with his loved ones,
a captive in the hands of merciless torturers, or lying
dead and mutilated upon the fields he had planted.</p>

<p>No wonder they are the Hopituh&mdash;the people of
peace. Who would not long for peace after many
generations of such environment? Poor wretches!
Every field had its memories of slaughter, every canyon
had echoed the fierce yells of attacking foes, the shrieks
of the dying, or the exultant shouts of the victors, and
every dwelling-place had heard the sad wailing of
widows and orphans.</p>

<p>The union of these people, under such conditions, in
towns became a necessity&mdash;self-preservation demanded
cohesion. That isolation and separation were not
unnatural or repulsive to them is shown by the readiness
with which in later times they branched out and established
new towns. These separations often led to bitter
and deadly quarrels among themselves, and elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
I have related the traditional story of the destruction of
a Hopi city, Awatobi, by the inhabitants of rival cities,
who in their determination to be "Hopituh"&mdash;people
of peace&mdash;were willing to fight and exterminate their
neighbors and thus compel peace.</p>

<p>Of the present seven mesa cities, towns, or villages of
the Hopis, it is probable that Oraibi only occupies the
same site that it had when first seen by white men in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
1540.</p>

<p>It will readily be recalled that when Coronado reached
Cibola (Zuni) and conquered it he was sadly disappointed
at not finding the piles of gold, silver, and precious
stones he and his conquistadors had hoped for.
The glittering stories of the gold-strewn "Seven Cities
of Cibola" were sadly proven to be mythical. But hope
revived when the wounded general was told of seven
other cities, about a hundred miles to the northwest.
<i>These</i> might be the wealthy cities they sought. Unable
to go himself, he sent his ensign Tobar, with a handful
of soldiers and a priest, and it fell to the lot of these to
be the first white men to gaze upon the wonders of the
Hopi villages.</p>

<p>Instead of finding them as we now see them, however,
it is pretty certain that the first village reached was that
of Awatobi, a town now in ruins and whose history is
only a memory. Standing on the mesa at Walpi and
looking a little to the right of the entrance to Keam's
Canyon, the location of this "dead city" may be seen.</p>

<p>Walpi occupied a terrace below where it now is, and
Sichumavi and Hano were not founded. At the middle
mesa Mashonganavi and Shungopavi occupied the
foothills or lower terraces, and Shipauluvi was not in
existence.</p>

<p>What an interesting conflict that was, in 1540, between
the few civilized and well-armed soldiers of Coronado
and the warrior priests of Awatobi. Tobar and
his men stealthily approached the foot of the mesa under
the cover of darkness, but were discovered in the early
morning ere they had made an attack. Led by the
warrior priests, the fighting men of the village descended
the trail, where the priests signified to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
strangers that they were unwelcome. They forbade
their ascending the trail, and with elaborate ceremony
sprinkled a line of sacred meal across it, over which no
one must pass. To cross that sacred and mystic line
was to declare one's self an enemy and to invite the
swift punishment of gods and men. But Tobar and his
warriors knew nothing of the vengeance of Hopi gods
and cared little for the anger of Hopi men, so they made
a fierce and sharp onslaught. When we remember that
this was the first experience of the Hopis with men on
horseback, protected with coats of mail and metal helmets,
who fought not only with sharpened swords, but
also slew men at a distance with sticks that belched forth
fire and smoke, to the accompaniment of loud thunder,
it can well be understood that they speedily fell back
and soon returned with tokens of submission. Thus
was Awatobi taken. After this Walpi, Mashonganavi,
Shungopavi, and Oraibi were more or less subjugated.</p>

<p>In 1680, as is well known, Popeh, a resident of one of
the eastern pueblos near the Rio Grande, conceived a
plan to rid the whole country of the hated white men,
and especially of the "long robes"&mdash;the priests&mdash;who
had forbidden the ancient ceremonies and dances,
and forcibly baptized their children into a new faith,
which to their superstitious minds was a catastrophe
worse than death. The Hopis joined in the plan,
though Awatobi went into it with reluctance, owing to
the kindly ministrations of the humane Padre Porras.</p>

<p>The plot was betrayed, but not early enough to enable
the Spaniards to protect themselves, and on the day of
Santa Ana, the 10th of August, 1680, the whole white
race was fallen upon and mercilessly slain or driven out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>For the next nearly twenty years the more timid of
the people lived in dread of Spanish retaliation. Then
it was that Hano was founded. Anticipating the arrival
of a large force, a number of Tanoan and Tewan
people fled from the Rio Grande to Tusayan. Some
of the former went to Oraibi, and the latter asked permission
to settle at the head of the Walpi trail near to
"the Gap."</p>

<p>Possibly about this same time, too, the villages located
on the lower terraces or foothills moved to the higher
sites, as they were thus afforded better protection.</p>

<p>Sichumavi&mdash;"the mound of flowers"&mdash;was founded
about the year 1750 by Walpians of the Badger Clan,
who for some reason or other grew discontented and
wished a town of their own. Here they were joined by
Tanoans of the Asa Clan from the Rio Grande, who for
a time had lived in the seclusion of the Tsegi, as the
Navahoes term the Canyon de Chelly in New Mexico.</p>

<p>Exactly when Shipauluvi was founded is not known,
though its name&mdash;"the place of peaches"&mdash;clearly denotes
that it must have been after the Spanish invasion,
for it was the conquerors who brought with them
peaches. Nor were peaches the only good things the
Hopis and other American aborigines owed to the
hated foreigners. They introduced horses, cows, sheep
(which latter have afforded them a large measure of
sustenance and given to them and the Navahoes the
material with which to make their useful rugs and blankets),
and goats, besides a number of vegetables.</p>

<p>Here, then, about the middle of the eighteenth century
the Hopi mesa towns were settled as we now find
them, and doubtless with populations as near as can be
to their present numbers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Hano we have already visited. Let us now, hastily
but carefully, glance at each of the other villages as
they appear at the present time.</p>

<p>Passing on to Sichumavi from Hano we find it
similar in all its main features to Hano, except that
none of its houses are as high. In the centre of the
town is a large plaza where, in wet weather, a large body
of rain-water collects. This is used for "laundry"
purposes, as drink for the burros and goats, and a bathing
pond for all the children of the pueblo. It is one of
the funniest sights imaginable to see the youngsters
playing and frolicking in the water by the hour,&mdash;I
should have said liquid mud, for the filth that accumulates
in this plaza reservoir is simply indescribable.
Children of both sexes, their brown, swarthy bodies
utterly indifferent to the piercing darts of the sun, lie
down in this liquid filth, roll over, splash one another,
run to and fro, and enjoy themselves hugely, even in
the presence of the white visitor, until a glimpse of the
dreaded camera sends them off splashing, yelling, gesticulating,
and some of them crying, to the nearest
shelter.</p>

<p>That supereminence of Hopi character is conservatism
is shown as one walks from Sichumavi to Walpi.
Here is a literal exemplification demonstrating how
the present generations "tread in the footsteps" of
their forefathers. The trail over which the bare and
moccasined feet of these people have passed and repassed
for years is worn down deep into the solid sandstone.
The springy and yielding foot, unprotected
except by its own epidermis or the dressed skin of the
goat, sheep, or deer, has cut its way into the unyielding
rock, thus symbolizing the power of an unyielding
purpose and demonstrating the force of an unchangeable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
conservatism.</p>

<p>Between these two pueblos the mesa becomes so
narrow that we walk on a mere strip of rock, deep
precipices on either side. To the left are Keam's Canyon
and the road over which we came; to the right are
the gardens, corn-fields, and peach orchards, leading
the eye across to the second mesa, on the heights of
which are Mashonganavi and Shipauluvi.</p>

<p>These gardens and corn-fields are the most potent
argument possible against the statements of ignorant
and prejudiced white men who claim that the Indians&mdash;Hopis
as well as others&mdash;are lazy and shiftless.</p>

<p>If a band of white men were placed in such a situation
as the Hopis, and compelled to wrest a living
from the sandy, barren, sun-scorched soil, there are
few who would have faith and courage enough to attempt
the evidently hopeless task. But with a patience
and steadiness that make the work sublime, these heroic
bronze men have sought out and found the spots of
sandy soil under which the water from the heights percolates.
They have marked the places where the summer's
freshets flow, and thus, relying upon sub-irrigation
and the casual and uncertain rainfalls of summer, have
planted their corn, beans, squash, melons, and chili,
carefully hoeing them when necessary, and each season
reap a harvest that would not disgrace modern scientific
methods.</p>

<p>All throughout these corn-fields temporary brush
sun-shelters are seen, under which the young boys and
girls sit, scaring away the birds and watching lest any
stray burro should enter and destroy that which has
grown as the result of so much labor.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a id="oraibi">

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span class="smcap">An Oraibi Woman shelling Corn in a

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span class="smcap">The "Burro" of Hopi Transportation.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Here, too, in the harvesting time one may witness
busy and interesting scenes. Whole families move
down into temporary brush homes, and women and
children aid the men in gathering the crops. Tethered
and hobbled burros stand patiently awaiting their share
of the common labor.</p>

<p>Yonder is a group of men busy digging a deep pit.
Watch them as it nears completion. It is made with
a narrow neck and "bellies" out to considerable width
below. Indeed, it is shaped not unlike an immense vase
with a large, almost spherical body and narrow neck.
In depth it is perhaps six, eight, ten, or a dozen feet.
On one side a narrow stairway is cut into the earth
leading down to its base, and at the foot of this stairway
a small hole is cut through into the chamber. Our
curiosity is aroused. What is this subterranean place
for? As we watch, the workers bring loads of greasewood
and other inflammable material, kindle a fire in the
chamber, and fill it up with the wood. Now we see the
use of the small hole at the foot of the stairway. It
acts as a draught hole, and soon a raging furnace fire is
in the vault before us. When a sufficient heat has been
obtained, the bottom hole is closed, and then scores of
loads of corn on the cob are dropped into the heated
chamber. When full, every avenue that could allow air
to enter is sealed, and there the corn remains over
night or as long as is required to cook it,&mdash;self-steam
it. It is then removed, packed in sacks or blankets on
the backs of the patient burros, and removed to the
corn-rooms of the houses on the mesa above.</p>

<p>Other fresh corn is carried up and spread out on the
house-tops to dry.</p>

<p>All this is stored away in the corn-rooms, into which
strangers sometimes are invited, but oftener kept away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
from. It is stacked up in piles like cord-wood, and
happy is that household whose corn-stack is large at
the beginning of a hard winter.</p>

<p>Walpi&mdash;the place of the gap&mdash;though not a large
town, is better known to whites than any of the other
Hopi towns. Here it was that the earliest visitors came
and saw the thrilling Snake Dance. Its southeastern
trail, with the wonderful detached rock leaning over
on one side and the cliff on the other, between which
the steep and rude stairway is constructed, has been so
often pictured, as well as the so-called "Sacred Rock"
of the Walpi dance plaza, that they are now as familiar
as photographs of Trinity Church, New York, or St.
Paul's, London. As one stands on the top of one of
the houses he sees how closely Walpi has been built.
It covers the whole of the south end of the mesa, up
to the very edges of the precipice walls in three of its
four directions, and, as already shown, the fourth is the
narrow neck of rock connecting Walpi with Sichumavi
and Hano. The dance plaza is to the east, a long,
narrow place, at the south end of which is the "Sacred
Rock." It is approached from south and north by the
regular "street" or trail, and one may leave it to the
west through an archway, over which is built one of
the houses.</p>

<p>Several ruins on the east mesa are pointed out as
"Old" Walpi, and the name of one of these&mdash;Nusaki&mdash;(also
known as Kisakobi) is a clear indication that at
one time the Spaniards had a mission church there.
A Walpian, Pauwatiwa, shows, with pride, an old
carved beam in his house which all Hopis say came
from the mission when it was destroyed. On the terraces
just below the mesa-top&mdash;perhaps a hundred or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
two hundred feet down&mdash;are a number of tiny corrals,
to and from which, morning and evening, the boys,
young men, and sometimes the women and girls may be
seen driving their herds of sheep and goats, and in
which the burros are kept when not in use. These
picturesque corrals from below look almost like swallows'
nests stuck on the face of the cliffs.</p>

<p>As we wander about in the narrow and quaint streets
of Walpi we cannot fail to observe the ladder-poles
which are thrust through hatchways, down which we
peer into the darkness below with little satisfaction.
These lead to the <i>kivas</i>, or sacred ceremonial chambers,
where all the secret rites of the different clans are held.
Here we shall be privileged to enter if no ceremony is
going on. The kivas are generally hewn out of the solid
rock, or partially so, and are from twelve to eighteen
feet square. When not otherwise occupied it is no uncommon
sight to see in a kiva a Hopi weaver squatted
before his rude loom, making a dress for his wife or
daughter, or weaving a ceremonial sash or kilt for his
own use in one of the many dances.</p>

<p>In every Hopi town one cannot fail to be struck with
the nudity of the children of all ages, from the merest
babies up to eight and even ten years. With what
Victor Hugo calls "the chaste indecency of childhood"
these fat, bronze Cupids and embryo Venuses romp and
play, as unconscious of their nakedness as Adam and
Eve before their fall.</p>

<p>From Walpi we descend to the corn-fields, and, after
a slow and tedious drag across the sandy plain to the
west, find ourselves at Mashonganavi, or at least at the
foot of the trail which leads to the heights above. Here,
as at the other mesas, there are two or three trails, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
steep, all nerve-wrenching, all picturesque. Arrived at
the village, we find Mashonganavi an interesting place,
for it is so compactly built that one often hunts in vain
(for a while, at least) to find the hidden dance plaza,
around which the whole town seems to be built. Some
of the houses are three stories high, and there are quaint,
narrow alley-ways, queer dark tunnels, and underground
kivas as at Walpi. The Antelope and Snake kivas are
situated on the southeastern side of the village, on the
very edge of the mesa, and with the tawny stretch of
the Painted Desert leading the eye to the deep purple
of the Giant's Chair and others of the Mogollon buttes,
which Ives conceived as great ships in the desert, suddenly
and forever arrested and petrified.</p>

<p>About one hundred and fifty feet below the village is
a terrace which almost surrounds the Mashonganavi
mesa, as a rocky ruff around its neck. This terrace is
so connected with the main plateau that one can drive
upon it with a wagon and thus encamp close to the
village. Here in 1901 the two wagon loads of sightseers
and tourists which I had guided to the mysteries
and delights of Tusayan, over the sandy and scorched
horrors of a portion of the Painted Desert, encamped,
during the last days of the Snake Dance ceremonies.</p>

<p>From here a trail&mdash;at its head an actual rock
stairway&mdash;leads down to a spring in the valley, where the
government school is situated, and from whence all our
cooking and drinking water had to be brought. Each
morning and evening droves of sheep and goats passed
our camp, coming up from below and going down to the
scant pasturage of the valley. Scarcely an hour passed
when some Indian&mdash;oftener half a dozen&mdash;came to
our camp, and failed to pass. Especially at meal times,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
when the biscuits were in the oven, the stew on the fire,
the beans in the pot, and the dried fruit in the
stew-kettle, did they seem to enjoy visiting us. And they
liked to come close, too; far too close for our comfort,
as their persons are not always of the most cleanly
character, and their habits of the most decorous and
refined. Hence rules had to be laid down which it was
my province to see observed, one of which was that visiting
Indians must keep to a distance, especially at meal
times. Another was that if our blankets were allowed
to remain unrolled (in order to get the direct benefit
of the sun's rays) they were not so left for our Indian
friends to lounge upon.</p>

<p>We were generally a hungry lot as we sat or squatted
around our canvas tablecloth, our table the rocky
ground, and there was scant ceremony when ceremony
stood in the way of appeasing our appetites. But we
were not wasteful. If there were any "scraps" or any
small remains on a plate or dish they were "saved
for the Indians." So that at length it became a catch-word
with us. If there was anything, anywhere, at any
time, that we did not like, some one of the party was
sure to suggest that it be "saved for the Indians." And
that has often since suggested to me our national policy
in treating the Amerind. There is too much national
"Save that for the Indians." Land that is no good to
a white man&mdash;save it for the Indians. Beef cattle that
white men don't buy&mdash;save them for the Indians.
Spoiled flour&mdash;save it for the Indians. Seeds that
won't grow&mdash;ship 'em to the Indians.</p>

<p>And that reminds me of a now not undistinguished
artist who once accompanied a small party of mine
some years ago to the Snake Dance at Oraibi. I came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
down to camp one day and found him cooking several
slices of our finest ham, dishing up our choicest and
scarcest vegetables, crackers, and delicacies, with a
large pot of our most expensive coffee simmering and
steaming by the camp-fire; and when I asked, "For
whom?" was coolly told it was for three lazy, fat,
lubberly, dirty Oraibis, who sat in delightful
anticipation around the pump close by.</p>

<p>My objection to this use of our provisions was
expressed in forceful and vigorous Anglo-Saxon, and
when I was told it was "none of my business," I
emphasized my objection with a distinct refusal to allow
<i>my</i> provisions to be thus used. Then for half an hour
immediately afterwards, and for days subsequently, at
intervals, I was regaled with vocal chastisement worthy
to be ranked with Demosthenes' "Philippics." "The
Indian was a man and a brother. We were Christians,
indeed, and of a truth when we would see our poor
red brother starve to death before our sight," etc.,
<i>ad libitum</i>.</p>

<p>Now between my artist friend's course and the one
first named the happy mean lies. I do not believe we
should give to the Indian only the scraps that fall
from our national table; neither, on the other hand,
do I believe we are called upon to give him the very
best of our foods and provide special coffee at
seventy-five cents a pound.</p>

<p>And this sermon has occupied our time, by the way,
as we have walked up the trail, by the Mashonganavi
kivas to a spot from which we gain a good view of the
village and of Shipauluvi on its higher and detached
pinnacle a mile farther back. Again descending the
trail to the terrace below, we walk half a mile and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
begin the ascent of a steep stone stairway, carefully
constructed, that leads us directly to Shipauluvi. This
is a small town, occupying almost the whole of the dizzy
site, with its few houses built around its rectangular
plaza.</p>

<p>Here I was once present at a witchcraft trial. It was
a complicated affair, in which the dead and living,
Navahoes and Hopis, were intertwined. A Hopi woman
accused a Navaho of having bewitched her husband,
thus causing his death, and of stealing from him a
blanket and some sheep. The evidence showed that
the Navaho had met the Hopi, and that soon afterwards
he was taken sick and died, whereupon the sheep and
blanket were found in the possession of the Navaho.
There was little doubt of its being a case of theft, and
the Navaho was ordered to return sheep and blanket,
but he was exonerated from the charge of witchcraft.</p>

<p>Living in Shipauluvi is one of those singular anomalies
so often found in the pueblos, an albino woman.
There are a dozen or so living in the other villages.
With Hopi face, but white hair and skin, pink eyes,
and general bleached-out appearance, they never fail
to excite the greatest surprise in the mind of the
stranger, and to those who see them often there is still
a lingering wonder as to the cause of so singular a
variation of physical appearance. At Mashonganavi
there are two men albinos, one of them one of the
Snake priests. It is claimed by the Indians that these
albinos are of as pure Hopi blood as those who are
normal in color, and the fact is incontrovertible that
they are born of pure-blooded parents on both sides.</p>

<p>Returning now to the terrace below, common to both
Mashonganavi and Shipauluvi, the trail is descended to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Shungopavi. A deep canyon separates the mesa upon
which this village is built from the one upon which the
two former are located. Near the foot of the trail the
government has established a schoolhouse, and close by
are the springs and pools of water. It is a sandy ride
or walk, and on a hot day&mdash;"a-tu-u-u"&mdash;wearisome
and exhausting. For half a dollar or so one may hire
a burro and his owner as guide, and it is much
easier to go burro-back over the yielding sand than to
walk. There are straggling peach trees on the way,
and a trail, rocky and steep, to ascend ere we see
Shungopavi.</p>

<p>The wagons may be driven to the village (as mine
were), but it is a long way around. The road to Oraibi
across the mesa is taken, and when about half-way
across a crude road is followed which runs out upon
the "finger tip" where Shungopavi stands. Here the
governor in 1901 was Lo-ma-win-i, and he and I became
very good friends. Knowing my interest in the Snake
Dance, he sent for the chief priests of the Snake and
Antelope Clans (Kai-wan-i-wi-ya-&#365;-m&aacute; and Lo-ma-ho-in-i-wa),
and from them I received a cordial invitation to
be present and participate in the secret ceremonials of
the kiva at their next celebration. I have been privileged
to be present, but was never invited before.</p>

<p>The governor is an expert silversmith, the necklace
he wears being a specimen of his own art. It is wonderful
how, with their crude materials and tools, such
excellent work can be produced. Mexican dollars
are melted in a tiny home-made crucible, rude moulds
are carved out of sand&mdash;or other stone into which the
melted metal is poured, and then hand manipulation,
hammering, and brazing complete the work. Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
silver articles of adornment are finger rings, bracelets,
and necklaces.</p>

<p>Oraibi is the most western and conservative of the
Hopi villages. It is by far the largest, having perhaps
a third of the whole population. It is divided into two
factions, the so-called hostiles and friendlies, the former
being the conservative element, determined not to forsake
"the ways of the old," the ways of their ancestors;
and the latter being generally willing to obey orders
ostensibly issued by "Wasintonia"&mdash;as they call the
mysterious Indian Department. These divisions are
a source of great sorrow to the former leaders of the
village. In the introduction to "The Oraibi Soyal
Ceremony" by Professor George A. Dorsey, of the Field
Columbian Museum, and Rev. H. R. Voth, his assistant,
and formerly a Mennonite missionary at Oraibi, this
dissension is spoken of as follows: "During the year
1891 representatives of the Indian Department made
strenuous efforts to secure pupils for the government
school located at Keam's Canyon, about forty miles
from Oraibi. This effort on the part of the government
was bitterly resented by a certain faction of the people
of Oraibi, who seceded from Lol&uacute;lomai, the village
chief, and soon after began to recognize Lomahungyoma
as leader. The feeling on the part of this faction
against the party under Lol&uacute;lomai was further intensified
by the friendly attitude the Liberals took toward
other undertakings of the government, such as allotment
of land in severalty, the building of dwelling-houses
at the foot of the mesa, the gratuitous distribution of
American clothing, agricultural implements, etc. The
division thus created manifested itself not only in the
everyday life of the people, but also in their religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
ceremonies. Inasmuch as the altars and their accessories
are the chief elements in these ceremonies, they
soon became the special object of controversy, each
party contending for their possession; and so it came
about that the altars remained to that faction to which
the chief priests and those who had them in charge
belonged, the members of the opposing faction, as
a rule, withdrawing from further participation in the
celebration of the ceremony."</p>

<p>The dance plaza is on the western side of the village,
and there the dances and other outdoor ceremonies take
place.</p>

<p>One of my earliest visits to Oraibi was made in the
congenial company of Major Constant Williams, who
was then the United States Indian Agent, at Fort
Defiance, for the Navahoes and Hopis. We had driven
across the Navaho Reservation from Fort Defiance to
Keam's Canyon, and then visited the mesas in succession.
We drove to the summit of the Oraibi mesa in
his buckboard, a new conveyance which he had had
made to order at Durango, Colo. The road was the
same one up which the soldiers had helped the horses
drag the Gatling gun at the time of the arrest of the
so-called "hostiles," who were sent to Alcatraz for their
refusal to forsake their Oraibi ways and follow the
"Washington way." It was a steep, ugly road, rough,
rocky, and dangerous. The Major's horses, however,
were strong, intelligent, and willing, so we made the
ascent with comparative ease. The return, however,
was different. There were so many things of interest
at Oraibi that I found it hard to tear myself away, and
the "shades of night were falling fast"&mdash;far too fast
for the Major's peace of mind&mdash;ere I returned to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
buckboard. By the time we had traversed the summit
of the mesa to the head of the "trail" part of the
descent, it was dark enough to make the cold tremors
perambulate up and down one's spine. But I had every
confidence in the Major's driving, his horses, and his
knowledge of that fearfully precipitous and dangerous
road. Slowly we descended, the brake scraping and
often entirely holding the wheels. We could see and
feel the dark abysses, first on one side and then on the
other, or feel the overshadowing of the mighty rock
walls which towered above us. I was congratulating
myself that we had passed all the dangerous places, and
in a few moments should be on the drifted sand, which,
though steep, was perfectly safe, when we came to the
last "drop off." This can best be imagined by calling
it what it was, a steep, rocky stairway, of two or three
steps, with a precipice on one side, and a towering wall
on the other. Hugging the wall, the upper step extended
like a shelf for eight or ten feet, and the nigh
horse, disliking to make the abrupt descent of the step,
clung close to the wall and walked along the shelf. The
off horse dropped down. The result can be imagined.
One horse's feet were up at about the level of the
other's back. The wheels followed their respective
horses. The nigh wheels stayed on the shelf, the off
wheels came down the step. The Major and I decided,
very suddenly, to leave the buckboard. We were rudely
toppled out, down the precipice on the left,&mdash;I at the
bottom of the heap. Down came camera cases, tripods,
boxes of plates, and all the packages of odds and ends
I had bought from the Indians, bouncing about our
ears. Like a flash the two horses took fright and started
off, dragging that overturned buckboard after them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
They did not swirl around to the left down the sandy
road, but to the right upon a terrace of the rocky mesa,
and we saw the sparks fly as the ironwork of the wagon
struck and restruck the rocks. The noise and roar and
clatter were terrific. Great rocks were started to rolling,
and the echoes were enough to awaken the dead.
Suddenly there was a louder crash than ever, and then
all was silent. We felt our hearts thumping against
our ribs, and the only sounds we could hear were
their fierce beatings and our own hard breathing.
Fortunately, we had landed on a narrow shelf some
seven feet down, covered deep with sand, so neither of
us was seriously hurt except in our feelings; but
imagine the dismay that swept aside all thoughts of
thankfulness for our narrow escape when that crash
and dread silence came. No doubt horses and buckboard
were precipitated over one of the cliffs and had
all gone to "eternal smash." My conscience made
me feel especially culpable, for had I not detained the
Major we should have left the mesa long before it was
so dark. I had caused the disaster! It was nothing
that I had been "spilt out," that doubtless my cameras
were smashed, and the plates I had exposed with so
much care and in spite of the opposition of the Hopis
were in tiny pieces&mdash;for I had clearly heard that
peculiar "smash" that spoke of broken glass as I
myself landed on the top of my head. Think of that
span of fine horses, and the Major's new buckboard!
The thought about completed the work of mental and
physical paralysis the shock of falling had begun. I
was suddenly awakened, not by the Major's voice, for
neither of us had yet spoken a word,&mdash;and indeed, I
didn't know but that he was dead,&mdash;but by the scratching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
of a match. Then he was alive! That was cause for
thankfulness. Setting fire to a dried cactus, the Major,
after thoroughly picking himself up and shaking himself
together, proceeded to gather up the photographic
d&eacute;bris. Silently I aided him. Still silently we piled it
all together, as much under the shelter of the rocks as
possible, and then, still without a word, we climbed
back upon the road and started to walk to the house of
Mr. Voth, the missionary, where we were stopping.
For half a mile or more we trudged on wearily through
the deep and yielding sand. Still never a word. We
both breathed heavily, for the sand was dreadfully soft.
I was wondering what I could say. My conscience so
overpowered me that I dared not speak. I was humbling
myself, inwardly, into the very dust for having been
the unconscious and innocent, yet nevertheless actual
cause of this disaster. I simply couldn't break the
silence. To offer to pay for the horses and buckboard
was easy (though that would be a serious matter to my
slender purse) compared with appeasing the sturdy
Major for the shock to his mental and physical system.
Then, too, how he must feel! At the very thought the
cold sweat started on my brow and I could feel it
trickling down my chest and back.</p>

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">An Admiring Hopi Mother.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Suddenly the Major stopped, and in the darkness I
could dimly see him take out his large white handkerchief,
mop his brow and head, and then, with explosive
force, but in a voice charged with deepest and sincerest
feeling he broke the painful silence: "Thank God, the
sun isn't shining."</p>

<p>Brave-hearted, generous Major Williams! Not a
word of reproach, no suggestion of blame. What a relief
to my burdened soul. I was almost hysterical in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
my ready response. Yes, we could be thankful that
our lives and limbs were spared. We were both unhurt.
New horses and buckboard could be purchased, but
life and health preserved called for thankfulness to the
Divine Protector.</p>

<p>Thus we congratulated ourselves as we slowly plodded
along through the sand. Arrived at Mr. Voth's, we
soon retired,&mdash;he in the bedroom prepared for him by
kindly Mrs. Voth, I in my blankets outside. The calm
face of the sky soon soothed my disquieted feelings and
nerves, and in a short time I fell asleep. Not a thought
disturbed me until just as the faintest peepings of dawn
began to show on the eastern ridges, when, awakening,
I heard a noise as of a horse shaking his harness close
by. Like a flash I jumped up, and, in my night-robe
though I was, rushed to the entrance to the corral.
There, unharmed and uninjured, with harness upon
them complete, the lines dangling down behind, the
neck yoke holding them together, as if they were just
brought from the stable ready to be hitched to the
wagon, were the two horses which I had vividly pictured
to myself as dashed to pieces upon the cruel rocks at
the foot of one of the mesa precipices.</p>

<p>I could scarcely refrain from shouting my joy.
Hastily I dressed, and while dressing thought: "The
horses are here; I'll go and hunt for the wagon." So
noiselessly I hitched them to Mr. Voth's buckboard and
drove off. When I came to the scene of the disaster, I
found I could drive upon the rocky terrace. There
was no difficulty in following the course of the runaways.
Here was part of the seat, farther on some of
the ironwork, and still farther the dashboard. At last I
reached the overturned and dismantled vehicle. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
in a sorry state. Two of the wheels were completely
dished, the seat and dashboard were "scraped" off, one
whiffletree was broken, and the whole thing looked as
if it had been rudely treated in a tornado. I turned
it over, tied the wheels so that they would hold, and
then, fastening it behind Mr. Voth's buckboard, slowly
drove back to the house.</p>

<p>When the Major awoke he was as much surprised and
pleased as I was to find the horses safe and sound and
the buckboard in a repairable condition. With a little
man&#630;uvring we got the vehicle as far as Keam's
Canyon, where old Jack Tobin, the blacksmith, fixed it
up so that it could be driven back to Fort Defiance,
and thither, with care and caution, the Major drove
me. A few weeks later, under the healing powers of
the agency blacksmith, the buckboard renewed its
youth,&mdash;new wheels, new seat, new dashboard, and an
all covering new coat of paint wiped out the memories
of our trip down from the Oraibi mesa, except those we
carried in the depths of our own consciousness.</p>

<h2><a name="ChV." id="ChV."></a>CHAPTER V<br />
<small>A FEW HOPI CUSTOMS</small></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">o</span> know any people thoroughly requires many
years of studied observation. The work of such
men as A. M. Stephen, Dr. Fewkes, Rev. H. R. Voth,
and Dr. George A. Dorsey reveals the vast field the
Hopis offer to students. To the published results of
these indefatigable workers the student is referred for
fuller knowledge. There are certain things of interest,
however, that the casual observer cannot fail to note.</p>

<p>The costume of the men is undoubtedly a modification
of the dress of the white man. Trousers are worn,
generally of white muslin, and from the knee down on
the outer side they are split open at the seam. Soleless
stockings, home-spun, dyed and knit, are worn, fastened
with garters, similar in style and design, though smaller,
to the sashes worn by the women. The feet are covered
with rawhide moccasins. The shirt is generally of
colored calico, though on special occasions the "dudes"
of the people appear in black or violet velvet shirts or
tunics, which certainly give them a handsome appearance.
The never-failing banda, wound around the forehead,
completes the costume, though accessories in the
shape of silver and wampum necklaces, finger rings, etc.,
are often worn.</p>

<p>The costume of the women is both picturesque and
adapted to their life and customs. It is neat, appropriate,
and modest. The effort our government feels called
upon to make to lead them to change it for calico<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
"wrappers," in accordance with a principle adopted
which regards as "bad" and "a hindrance to civilization"
anything native, is to my mind vicious and senseless.
The Indians are not to be civilized by making
them wear white people's costumes, nor by any such
nonsense. There are those who condemn their basket
weaving, because, forsooth, it is not a Christian art.
True civilizing processes come from within, and desire
for change must precede the outward manifestation if
permanent results are desired.</p>

<p>To return to the costume. It consists mainly of a
home-woven robe, dyed in indigo. When made, it
looks more like an Indian blanket than a dress, but
when the woman throws it over her right shoulder, sews
the two sides together, leaving an opening for the right
arm, and then wraps one of the highly colored and
finely woven sashes around her waist, the beholder sees
a dress at once healthful and picturesque. As a rule,
it comes down a little below the knee, and the left
shoulder is uncovered. Of late years many of the
women and girls have learned to wear a calico slip
under the picturesque native dress, so that both arms
and shoulders are covered.</p>

<p>Most of the time the legs and feet are naked, but
when a woman wishes to be fully attired, she wraps
buckskins, cut obliquely in half, around her legs, adroitly
fastening the wrappings just above the knee with thongs
cut from buckskin, and then encases her feet in shapely
moccasins. There is no compression of her solid feet,
no distortion with senseless high heels. She is too self-poised,
mentally, to care anything about Parisian fashions.
Health, neatness, comfort, are the desiderata sought and
obtained in her dress. The question is sometimes asked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
however, if the heavy leg swathings of buckskin are not
a mere fashion of Hopi dress. Undoubtedly there is a
following of custom here as well as elsewhere, and, as I
have before remarked, one of the keys to the Hopi character
is his conservatism. But the buckskin leggings
have a decided reason for their existence. In a desert
country where cacti, cholla, many varieties of prickly
shrubs, sharp rocks, and dangerous reptiles abound, it is
necessary that the women whose work calls them into
these dangers should so dress as to be prepared to overcome
them. Many a man wearing the ordinary trousers
of civilization and finding himself off the beaten paths of
these desert regions has longed for just such protection
as the Hopi women give themselves. The cow-boys who
ride pell-mell through the brush wear leather trousers,
and their stirrups are covered with tough and thick
leather to protect their shoes from being pierced by the
searching needles of the cactus, cholla, and buck-brush.</p>

<p>The adornments that a Hopi maiden of fashion affects
are silver rings and bracelets made by native silversmiths,
and necklaces of coral, glass, amber, or more generally
of the shell wampum found all over the continent. The
finer necklets of wampum are highly prized, and when
very old and ornamented with pieces of turquoise, can
not be purchased for large sums. Occasionally ear
pendants are worn. These are made of wood, half an
inch broad and an inch long, inlaid on one side with
pieces of bright shell, turquoise, etc.</p>

<p>When a girl reaches the marriageable age, she is
required by the customs of her people to fix up her hair
in two large whorls, one on each side of her head.
This gives her a most striking appearance. The whorl
represents the squash blossom, which is the Hopi emblem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
of purity and maidenhood. Girls mature very
early, the young maidens herewith represented being not
more than from twelve to fifteen years of age.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="shupela"></a>

  </div>
</div>

<p>When a woman marries she must no longer wear the
nash-mi (whorls). A new symbolism must be introduced.
The hair is done up in two pendant rolls, in
imitation of the ripened fruit of the long squash, which
is the Hopi emblem of fruitfulness.</p>

<p>In my book on "Indian Basketry" I have described
in detail the basketry of the Hopis. There are two distinct
varieties made at the four villages of the middle
and western mesas. Those made on the middle mesa
are of yucca fibre (mo-hu) coiled around a core of grass
or broom-corn (s&#369;-&#369;). Those of Oraibi are of willow
and approximate as nearly to the crude willow work of
civilization as any basketry made by the aborigines. In
both cases the splints are dyed, commonly nowadays
with the startling aniline dyes, and with marvellous
fertility of invention the weavers make a thousand and
one geometrical designs, in imitation of natural objects,
katchinas, etc. These are mainly plaques, but the yucca
fibre weavers make a treasure or trinket basket, somewhat
barrel-shaped, oftentimes with a lid, that is both
pretty and useful. The name for all the yucca variety
is p&#369;-&#369;-ta. The Oraibi willow plaques are called yung-ya-pa,
while a bowl-shaped basket is sa-kah-ta, and the
bowls made of coiled willow splints bought from the
Havasupai are s&#369;-k&#369;-w&#369;-ta.</p>

<p>The Hopi weavers when at work invariably keep a
blanket full of moist sand near them in which the splints
are buried. This keeps them flexible, and the moist
sand is better than water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>A reddish-brown native dye is made from Ohaishi
(<i>Thelesperma gracile</i>), with which the splints are colored.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the introduction of aniline dyes has
almost killed the industry of making native dyes, but
there are some few conservatives&mdash;God bless them!&mdash;who
adhere to the ancient colors and methods of preparing
them.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that the Hopis are devoid of musical
taste, for in the early morning especially, as the
youths and men take their ponies or flocks of goats and
sheep out to pasture, they sing with sweet and far-reaching
voices many picturesque melodies.</p>

<p>Of the weird singing at their religious ceremonials I
have spoken in the chapter devoted to that purpose.</p>

<p>To most civilized ears Hopi instrumental music, however,
is as much a racket and din as is Chinese music.
The lelentu, or flute, however, produces weird, soft,
melancholy music. Their rattles are of three kinds, the
gourd rattle (ai-i-ya), the rattle used by the Antelope
priests, and the leg rattle of turtle shell and sheep's
trotters (y&#533;ng-ush-o-na). The drum and hand tombe
are crude affairs, the former made by hollowing out a
tree trunk and stretching over each end wet rawhide, the
lashings also being of strips of wet rawhide (with the
hair on), which, when dry, tightens so as to give
the required resonance. The hand tombe is as near
like a home-made tambourine as can be. It has no
jingles, however. Another instrument is the strangest
conception imaginable. It consists of a large gourd
shell, from the top of which a square hole has been cut.
Across this is placed a notched stick, one end of which
is held in the performer's left hand. In the other hand
is a sheep's thigh-bone, which is worked back and forth
over the notched stick, and the resultant noise is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
desired music. This instrument is the zhe-gun&acute;-pi.</p>

<p>They do not seem to have many games, so many
of their religious ceremonials affording them the
diversion other peoples seek in athletic sports. Their
racing is purely religious, as I have elsewhere shown,
and they get much fun out of some of their semi-religious
exercises.</p>

<p>A game that they are very fond of, and that requires
considerable skill to play, is w&#275;-la. The game consists
in several players, each armed with a feathered dart, or
ma-te&acute;-va, rushing after a small hoop made of corn
husks or broom-corn well bound together&mdash;the w&#275;-la,
and throwing their darts so that they stick into it
The hoop is about a foot in diameter and two inches
thick, the ma-te&acute;-va nearly a foot long. Each player's
dart has a different color of feathers, so that each can
tell when he scores. To see a dozen swarthy and
almost nude youths darting along in the dance plaza,
or streets, or down in the valley on the sand, laughing,
shouting, gesticulating, every now and then stopping
for a moment, jabbering over the score, then eagerly
following the motion of the thrower of the w&#275;-la so as
to be ready to strike the ma-te&acute;-va into it, and then,
suddenly letting them fly, is a picturesque and lively
sight.</p>

<p>The Hopi is quite a traveller. Though fond of home,
I have met members of the tribe in varied quarters of
the Painted Desert Region. They get a birch bark
from the Verdi Valley with which they make the dye
for their moccasins. A yellowish brown color, called
<i>pavissa</i>, is obtained from a point near the junction of
the Little Colorado and Marble Canyon. Here they
obtain salt, and at the bottom of the salt springs, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the waters bubble up in pools, this <i>pavissa</i> settles.
Bahos, or prayer sticks, are always deposited at the
time of obtaining this ochre, as it is to be used in the
painting of the face of the bahos used in most sacred
ceremonies. The so-called Moki trail is evidence of the
long association between the Hopis and the Havasupais
in Havasu (Cataract) Canyon, and I have often met
them there trading blankets, horses, etc., for buckskin
and the finely woven wicker bowl-baskets&mdash;k&#369;-&#369;s&mdash;of
the Havasupais, which are much prized by the Hopis.</p>

<p>Occasionally he reaches as far northeast as Lee's
Ferry and even crosses into southern Utah, and at Zuni
to the southeast he is ever a welcome visitor. The
Apaches in the White Mountains tell that on occasions
the Hopis will visit them, and when visiting the Yumas in
1902 they informed me that long ago the Snake Dancing
Mokis were their friends, and sometimes came to
see them.</p>

<p>Dr. Walter Hough has written a most interesting
paper on "Environmental Interrelations in Arizona,"
in which are many items about the Hopis. He says
they brought from their priscan home corn, beans,
melons, squash, cotton, and some garden plants, and
that they have since acquired peaches, apricots, and
wheat, and among other plants which they infrequently
cultivate may be named onions, chili, sunflowers,
sorghum, tomatoes, potatoes, grapes, pumpkins, garlic,
coxcomb, coriander, saffron, tobacco, and nectarines.
They are great beggars for seeds and will try any kind
that may be given to them.</p>

<p>Owing to their dependence upon wild grasses for
food when their corn crops used to fail,&mdash;that is, in the
days before a paternal government helped them out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
at such times,&mdash;every Hopi child was a trained botanist
from his earliest years; not trained from our
standpoint, but from theirs. We should say much of his
knowledge was unscientific, and it goes far beyond the
use of grasses and plants as food. Dr. Hough in his
paper gives a number of examples of the uses to which
the various seeds, etc., are put. The botanist as well
as the ethnologist will find this a most comprehensive
and useful list. For food forty-seven seeds, berries,
stems, leaves, or roots are eaten. The seeds of a
species of sporobolus are ground with corn to make
a kind of cake, which the Hopis greatly enjoy. The
leaves of a number are cooked and eaten as greens.</p>

<p>A large amount of folk-lore connected with plants has
been collected by Drs. Fewkes and Hough. From the
latter's extensive list I quote. For headache the leaves
of the <i>Astragalus mollissimus</i> are bruised and rubbed
on the temples; tea is made from the root of the <i>Gaura
parviflora</i> for snake bite; women boil the <i>Townsendia
arizonica</i> into a tea and drink it to induce pregnancy;
a plant called by the Hopi <i>w&#369;takpala</i> is rubbed on the
breast or legs for pain; <i>Verbesina enceloides</i> is used on
boils or for skin diseases; <i>Croton texlusis</i> is taken as
an emetic; <i>Allionia linearis</i> is boiled to make an
infusion for wounds; the mistletoe that grows on the
juniper (<i>Phoradendron juniperinum</i>) makes a beverage
which both Hopi and Navaho say is like coffee, and a
species that grows on the cottonwood, called <i>lo mapi</i>,
is used as medicine; the leaves of <i>Gilia longiflora</i> are
boiled and drank for stomach ache; the leaves of the
<i>Gilia multiflora</i> (which is collected forty miles south
of Walpi at an elevation of six thousand feet), when
bruised and rubbed on ant bites is said to be a specific;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
<i>Oreocarya suffruticosa</i> is pounded up and used for pains
in the body; <i>Carduus rothrockii</i> is boiled and drank as
tea for colds which give rise to a prickling sensation
in the throat; the leaves of <i>Coleosanthus wrightii</i> are
bruised and rubbed on the temples for headache, as
also is the <i>Artemisia canadensis</i>; and so on throughout
a list as long again as this.</p>

<p>In connection with this list Dr. Hough calls attention
to the workings of the Hopi mind in a manner which
justifies an extensive quotation:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The word 'medicine' as applied by the Hopi and other
tribes is very comprehensive, including charms to influence gods,
men, and animals, or to cure a stomach ache. As stated, from
experiments with the plants some have been discovered which
are uniform in action and which would have place in a standard
pharmacop&#339;ia. Thus there are heating plasters, powders for
dressing wounds, emetics, diuretics, purges, sudorific infusions,
etc. Other plants are of doubtful value, and in their use other
animistic ideas may enter, though some of them, such as those
infused for colds, headache, rheumatism, fever, etc., may have
therapeutic properties. The obligation of the civilized to the
uncivilized for healing plants is very great. Another class is
clearly out of the domain of empirical medicine. Tea made
from the thistle is a remedy for prickling pains in the larynx,
milkweed will induce a flow of milk, and there are other examples
of inferential medicine. Perhaps another class is shown
by the employment of the plant named for the bat, in order to
induce sleep in the daytime.</p>

<p>"It may be interesting to look into the workings of the
Indian mind as shown by his explanation of the uses of certain
of these plants.</p>

<p>"A beautiful scarlet gilia (<i>Gilia aggregata</i> Spreng) grows on
the talus of the giant mesa on which ancient Awatobi stood.
This is the only locality where the plant has been collected in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
this region, but it grows in profusion on the White Mountains,
one hundred and twenty-five miles southeast.</p>

<p>"The herdsman of our party was asked the name and use
of the plant. He replied: 'It is the <i>pala katchi</i>, or red male
flower, and it is very good for catching antelope. Before going
out to kill antelope, hunters rub up the flowers and leaves of
the plant and mix them with the meal which they offer during
their prayer to the gods of the chase.'</p>

<p>"'Why is that?' was asked.</p>

<p>"'Because,' he replied, 'the antelope is very fond of this
plant and eats it greedily when he can find it.' (Animistic
idea.)</p>

<p>"Another creeping plant (<i>Solanum triflorum</i> Nutt.), which
bears numerous green fruit about the size of a cherry, filled
with small seeds, is called <i>cavayo ngahu</i>, or watermelon
medicine. The plant may be likened to a miniature watermelon
vine. It was explained that if one took the fruit and planted
it in the same hill with the watermelon seeds, would there
be many watermelons,&mdash;that is, the watermelon would be
influenced to become as prolific as the small plant.</p>

<p>"Every one is familiar with the clematis bearing fluffy
bunches of seeds having long, hair-like appendages. An
Indian lecturing on a collected specimen of the clematis said:
'This is very good to make the hair grow. You make a tea
of it and rub it on the head, and pretty quick your hair will
hang down to your hips,' indicating by a gesture the extraordinary
length. For the same reason the fallugia is a good
hair tonic."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Hopi uses a weapon for catching rabbits which,
for want of a better name, white men call a boomerang.
It possesses none of the strange properties of the
Australian weapon, yet in the hands of a skilled Hopi it is
wonderfully effective. I have seen fifty Oraibis on
horseback, and numbers of men and boys on foot, each armed
with one of these weapons, on their rabbit drive. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
determine on a certain area and then beat it thoroughly
for rabbits, and woe be to the unhappy cottontail or even
lightning-legged jack-rabbit if a Hopi throws his boomerang.
Like the wind it speeds true to its aim and
seldom fails to kill or seriously wound.</p>

<p>Though most of the men have guns and many of the
youths revolvers, the bow and arrow as a weapon is not
entirely discarded. All the young boys, even little tots
that can scarcely walk, use the bow and arrow with
dexterity. A small hard melon or pumpkin is thrown
into the air and a child will sometimes put two or even
three arrows into it before it reaches the ground. Old
men who are too poor to own modern weapons are often
seen sitting like the proverbial and oft-pictured fox,
stealthily watching for a ground squirrel, prairie-dog,
or rat to come out of his hole, when the speedy and
certain arrow is let fly to his undoing.</p>

<p>Except for a little wild meat of this kind, secured
seldom, or a sheep, which is too valuable for its wool to
kill on any except very special and rare occasions, the
Hopis are practically vegetarians. They are not above
taking what the gods send them, however, in the shape
of a dead horse. A few years ago Mr. D. M. Riordan,
formerly of Flagstaff, conducted a party of friends over a
large section of the region presented in these pages, and
when near Oraibi a beautiful mare of one of the teams
suddenly bloated and speedily died. In less than an
hour after they were told they might take the flesh; the
Hopis had skinned it, cut up the carcass, and removed
every shred of it. I afterwards saw the flesh cut into
strips, hung outside the houses of the fortunate possessors
to dry, and I doubt not that horse meat made
many a happy meal for them during the months that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
followed.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span class="smcap">Hopi Children, at Oraibi, Waiting for
a Scramble of Candy.</span></p>

<p>When a Hopi feels rich he may buy a sheep or a goat
from a Navaho, or even kill a burro in order to vary
his dietary.</p>

<p>Corn is his staple food. It is cooked in a variety of
ways, but the three principal methods are piki, pikami,
and p&#363;-v&#363;-l&#363;. Piki is a thin, wafer-like bread,
cooked as I have before described.</p>

<p>On one occasion, at Oraibi, an old friend, Na-wi-so-ma,
was making piki for the Snake Dancers. When I took
my friends to see her, they all ate of the bread and asked
her all manner of questions about it.</p>

<p>Na-wi-so-ma was very kind and obliging. One of my
party wished to make moving photographs of the operation
of making piki, so she cheerfully moved her t&#333;&#333;-ma
(cooking stone) outside. She insisted upon placing it,
however, so that her back was to the blazing sun, which
rendered it impossible to make the photographs. It
was in vain that I explained to her why she must face
the sun, and, at last, in desperation, I seized the heavy
t&#333;&#333;-ma and carried it where I desired it to be. In my
haste in putting it down&mdash;rather, dropping it&mdash;it
snapped in two, and I had to repair the damage to her
stone and feelings with a piece of silver ere we could
proceed.</p>

<p>Pikami is made as follows: A certain amount of corn-meal
is mixed with a small amount of sugar, and coloring
matter made from squash flowers. This mixture is
then placed in an earthenware vessel, or olla, and a
cover tightly sealed on the vessel with mud. It is now
ready to go into the oven. The pikami oven is generally
out of doors. Sometimes it is a mere hole in the
ground, without a covering, but the better style is where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the hole is located in the angle of two walls and partially
covered. A broken olla is made to serve as a chimney.
To prepare the oven, sticks of wood are placed inside it
and set on fire. When these are reduced to flaming
coals and the oven is red hot, the coals are withdrawn,
and the olla containing the corn-meal mixture is lowered
into the hole. This is then covered with a stone slab,
sealed with mud, and allowed to remain closed for
several hours. When the oven is unsealed and the olla
withdrawn, the corn-meal is thoroughly cooked&mdash;now
pikami&mdash;and the dish is both nutritious and delicious.</p>

<p>P&#363;-v&#363;-l&#363; is a corn-meal preparation that corresponds
somewhat to the New England doughnut. On one
occasion, just before the Snake Dance at Mashonganavi,
I found Ma-sa-wi-ni-ma, Kuchyeampsi's mother, busy
preparing the dish. When I induced her to come into
the sunshine to be photographed, stirring the meal, just
eight other kodak and camera fiends insisted upon
"shooting" her at the same time. She was very complacent
about it, especially when I collected ten cents a
head for her, and handed her ninety cents for her five
minutes' pose.</p>

<p>Her method was as follows: Into a cha-ka-ta (bowl)
she placed corn-meal and a little coloring matter. Then
adding sugar and water, she stirred it with a stick, as
shown in the photograph. It was made to a thick
dough. In the meantime a pan of water, into which
mutton fat had been placed, was on the fire, and when it
was hot enough small balls of the corn-meal dough were
dropped into the water and fat and allowed to remain
until cooked. The result is a not unpleasant food,
of which the Hopis are very fond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the common dishes, when a sheep has been
killed, is the ne&#369;-euck&acute;-que-vi, a stew composed of corn,
mutton, and chili.</p>

<p>So far the Hopis have not been a success as traders.
It is a slow and long journey from aboriginal life to
civilization. One of the young men who had been to
school, a bright youth of some twenty-three
years,&mdash;Kuy-an-im&acute;-ti-wa,&mdash;was fired with a desire to trade with
his people on his own account. Permission was given
him by the agent to start a store. A small building was
speedily erected at the foot of the Mashonganavi mesa
and a stock of goods purchased. For a while things
went well. Then Kuyanimtiwa had to go away on
business, and an elderly uncle (I think it was) took
charge of the store in his absence. When the embryo
trader returned he found his shelves nearly empty, and
a lot of trash accumulated under his counter, which the
old man had taken "in trade." The credits of many
Hopis had been extended and enlarged without proper
consulting of Bradstreet's or Dun's, and blank ruin
stared poor Kuyanimtiwa in the face. I purchased
about eighty dollars' worth of baskets and "truck" from
him, for which, however, I was compelled to give him
my check. For long weeks, indeed months, the check
did not come in, until I feared the poor fellow had lost
it. When I inquired I found it was in the hands of
the agent, being held as security until some disposal
was made of a suit between the old man and Kuyanimtiwa.
It ultimately reached the bank, so I assume
the trouble was ended, but it will be some time, if what
he said has lasting force, before the young Hopi will
open store again with an untrained assistant.</p>

<p>In an earlier chapter I have shown that the women
build and own the houses. In return the men knit the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
stockings and weave the women's dresses and sashes.
With looms very similar to those described in the
chapter on "Navaho Blanketry," they make the dresses
we have seen the women wearing. In the days before
the Spaniards introduced sheep the Hopis grew cotton
quite extensively, dyed it with the simple but beautiful
and permanent dyes, and wove it into garments.
The blue of the dresses was originally obtained&mdash;and
is yet by some&mdash;from the seeds of the sunflower.</p>

<p>In several cases I have found blind men engaged in
knitting stockings. With needles of wood, long and slender,
their fingers busily moved as those of the old housewives
used to do in my boyhood's days. One was an old
man, Tu-ki-i&acute;-ma. He was "si-bo&acute;-si" (blind), and expressed
his thankfulness for the occupation. Another
poor old man, stone blind, was winding yarn into a ball.
He was squatted upon the ground, with the yarn around
his feet and knees. It was a pathetic sight to see the old
and forlorn creature anxious to make himself useful,
even though blind and aged.</p>

<p>There are a score of other interesting matters I should
enjoy referring to did space permit, but these must be
left for some future time.</p>

<p>That they are picturesque and interesting, and in some
of their ceremonies fascinating, there is no question.
They are religious (in their way), domestic, honest,
faithful, industrious, and chaste. But there is no denying
that many of them are dirty,&mdash;really, indescribably filthy.
One of my old drivers, Franklin French, used to say
with a turn up of his nose: "I'd rather associate with
a good skunk who was up in the skunk business than get
to leeward of a Moki town." Their sanitary accommodations
are <i>nil</i>, and their habits accord with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
accommodations. Were it not for the fierce rays of the
sun and the strong winds that purify their elevated mesa-tops,
the accumulated evils would soon render habitation
impossible. Water being so scarce, they are not habitually
cleanly in person, as are some of the other peoples.
Hence the contempt with which many of the Navahoes
regard them.</p>

<p>Of course there are exceptions, where both houses
and individuals are as neat and clean as can be. Among
Hopis as well as among whites, it is not possible to
generalize too widely.</p>

<h2><a name="ChVI." id="ChVI."></a>CHAPTER VI<br />
<small>THE RELIGIOUS LIFE OF THE HOPI</small></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> Hopi is essentially religious. As a ritualist
he has no superior on the face of the earth.
From the ceremonial standpoint the Hopi people are
the most religious nation known. From four to sixteen
days of every month are employed by one society or
another in the performance of secret religious rites, or
in public ceremonies, which, for want of a better name,
the whites call dances. So complex, indeed, is the
Hopi's religious life that we have no complete calendar
as yet of <i>all</i> the ceremonies that he feels called upon
to observe. Every act of his life from the cradle to the
grave has a religious side. Fear and the need for propitiation
are the motive powers of his religious life, and
these, combined with his stanch conservatism, render
him a wonderfully fertile subject for study as to the
workings of the child mind of the human race.</p>

<p>With such a complex and vast religious system this
chapter can attempt no more than merely to outline or
suggest the thoughts upon which his religion is based,
and then, in brief, describe two or three of the most
important of his religious ceremonials.</p>

<p>I can do better than attempt a difficult matter, and
one that requires years of study, viz., to account for
the religious concepts of the Indian. I can urge the
reader to obtain Major J. W. Powell's "Lessons of
Folk-lore," which appeared in the <i>American Anthropologist</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
for January-March, 1900. In it he has written
a most fascinating account of the thought movements
of the Amerind; and Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, in his
"Interpretation of Katchina Worship," has given a
clearer idea of Hopi religious belief than has ever before
been penned.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a id="maidens">
<img class="border" style="margin-top: 1em;" src="images/image17.jpg" width="450" height="670" alt="Group of Hopi Maidens at Shungopavi." />
</a></div>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span class="smcap">Group of Hopi Maidens at Shungopavi.</span></p>

<p>The Hopis themselves are not aware of the why and
wherefore of all they do. For centuries they have followed
"the ways of the old," until they are ultra conservatives,
especially in matters pertaining to religion.</p>

<p>I have already referred to and described the kivas
or underground ceremonial chambers, where many of
their rites are performed.</p>

<p>Six objects closely connected with their worship
should be thoroughly understood, as such knowledge
will simplify a thousand and one things that will otherwise
appear mysterious to one who visits the Hopis for
the first time. These objects are the <i>baho</i> (prayer stick
or plume), the <i>puhtabi</i> (road marker), the <i>tiponi</i>, the
<i>natchi</i>, the <i>shrine</i>, and the <i>katchina</i>.</p>

<p>The baho is inseparably connected with all religious
ceremonies and prayers. Without it prayers would
be inefficacious. Generally, before every ceremony is
performed, a certain time is given to the making of
bahos. One form of baho is made of two sticks, painted
green with black points, one male and the other female,
tied together with a string made of native cotton, and
cut to a prescribed length. A small corn husk, shaped
like a funnel and holding a little prayer meal and honey,
is attached to the sticks at their place of union. Tied
to this husk is a short, four-stranded cotton string, on
the end of which are two small feathers. A turkey
wing-feather and a sprig of two certain herbs are tied so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
as to protrude above the butt ends of the sticks, and
the baho is complete.</p>

<p>Other bahos are made of flat pieces of board, anywhere
from a foot to three feet in length, and two
inches or more wide, to which feathers and herbs are
attached. On the face of these figures of katchinas,
animals, reptiles, and natural objects, such as rain-clouds,
descending rain, corn, etc., are painted, every
object having a distinct and symbolic meaning. In other
cases the bahos are carved into the zigzag shape of the
lightning. The Soyal bahos are many and various.
Some are long, thin sticks, with cotton strings and feathers
attached near the ends; others are thicker, with many
feathers tied to the centre; some are bent or crook-shaped,
while still others are long willow switches to
which eagle, hawk, turkey, flicker, and other feathers
are tied. They are made with great care and solemnity
and prayed over and "consecrated" before being used.
They are "prayer bearers," the feathers symbolizing
the birds who used to fly to and from the World of the
Powers with their messages to mankind and the answers
thereto.</p>

<p>The puhtabi (or road marker) is a long piece of
native cotton string, to which a feather or feathers are
attached, and it is placed on the trails to mark the beginning
of the road (hence its name) to the shrines
which are to be visited during the ceremonies.</p>

<p>The tiponi is to the Hopi what the cross is to the
devout Catholic. No altar is complete without it.
Altars are often set up with a substitute for a tiponi,
but all recognize its insufficiency. Tiponis vary, that
of the Antelope Society being a bunch of long feathers
(see the photograph in the chapter on the "Snake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Dance"), while that of the Soyal ceremony is of a
quartz crystal inserted into a cylindrical-shaped vessel
of cottonwood root.</p>

<p>In the Lelentu and Lalakonti ceremonies part of the
rites consist in an unwrapping of the tiponis. In both
of them either kernels of corn or other seeds formed
essential parts. Dr. Fewkes says: "From chiefs of
other societies it has been learned that their tiponis
likewise contained corn, either in grains or on the ear.
Although from this information one is not justified in
concluding that all tiponis contain corn, it is probably
true with one or two exceptions. The tiponi is called
the "mother," and an ear of corn given to a novice has
the same name. There is nothing more precious to an
agricultural people than seed, and we may well imagine
that during the early Hopi migrations the danger of
losing it may have led to every precaution for its safety.
Thus it may have happened that it was wrapped in the
tiponi and given to the chief to guard with all care as
a most precious heritage. In this manner it became
a mere symbol, and as such it persists to-day."</p>

<p>Whenever ceremonies are about to take place in the
kivas the chief priest puts in place on the ladder-poles
or near the hatchway of each participating kiva a sign
of the fact, called the natchi. This I have later described
on the Snake and Antelope kivas. At the
Soyal ceremony on the Kwan (Agave) kiva, the natchi
consisted of a bent stick, to which were fastened six
feathers, representing the Hopi six world-quarters. For
the north, a yellow feather of the flycatcher or warbler;
for the west, a blue feather of the bluebird; for the
south, a red feather of the parrot; for the east, a
black-and-white feather of the magpie; for the northeast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
(above), a black feather of the hepatic tanager; and for
the southwest (below), a feather from an unknown source
and called <i>toposhkwa</i>, representing different colors.</p>

<p>The natchis of two of the kivas in the New Fire
ceremony held in Walpi in 1898 were sticks, about a
foot long, to the ends of which bundles of hawk feathers
were attached. At another kiva it was an agave stalk,
at one end of which were attached several crane feathers
and a circlet of corn husks. A natchi used later by
another society consisted of a cap-shaped object of
basketry, to which were attached two small whitened
gourds in imitation of horns.</p>

<p>That the natchi is more than a sign of warning to
outsiders to keep away from the secret rites of the kiva
is evidenced by the variety of materials used; and,
indeed, the things themselves are now known to be
symbols, to some of which Mr. Voth has learned the
key. For instance, on the natchi of the Snake and
Antelope Societies, the skins of the <i>piwani</i>&mdash;which is
supposed to be the weasel&mdash;are attached. The Hopis
say of the animal to whom the skin belongs that when
chased into a hole, he works his way through the
ground so quickly that he escapes and "gets out" at
some other place. Now see the ceremonial significance
of the use of this weasel's skin on the Snake
natchi. They are supposed to affect the clouds and compel
them to "come out," so that rain will come quickly.</p>

<p>Near all the villages, or on the terraces below, a
number of shrines may be found where certain of the
"Powers" are worshipped. In the account of the Snake
Dance I speak of the shrine of the Spider Woman, and
show the photograph made when I followed Tubangointiwa
(the Antelope chief), and watched him deposit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
bahos and offer prayers to her. The number of shrines
is large. I have seen many, but there is not space
here to describe them. It is an interesting occupation,
during the ceremonies, to follow the priests, after they
have deposited the puhtabi and begun to sprinkle the
sacred meal, to the shrines. If the observer can then
have explained to him the deity to whom the shrine is
dedicated, and his or her place in the Hopi pantheon,
his knowledge of Hopi worship will be considerably
increased.</p>

<p>Of katchinas much might be written. They are
ancient ancestral representatives of certain Hopi clans
who, as spirits of the dead, are endowed with powers
to aid the living members of the clan in material ways.
The clans, therefore, pray to them that these material
blessings may be given. "It is an almost universal
idea of primitive man," says Fewkes, "that prayers
should be addressed to personations of the beings
worshipped. In the carrying out of this conception
men personate the katchinas, wearing masks and dressing
in the costumes characteristic of these beings. These
personations represent to the Hopi mind their idea of
the appearance of these katchinas or clan ancients.
The spirit beings represented in these personations
appear at certain times in the pueblo, dancing before
spectators, receiving prayer for needed blessings, as
rain and good crops."</p>

<p>The katchinas are supposed to come to the earth
from the underworld in February and remain until July,
when they say farewell. Hence there are two specific
times which dramatically celebrate the arrival and
departure of the katchinas. The former of these times
is called by the Hopi <i>Powam&ucirc;</i>, and the latter <i>Niman</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
At these festivals, or merry dances, certain members
of the participating clans wear masks representing
the katchinas, hence katchina masks are often to
be found in Hopi houses when one is privileged to
see the treasures stored away. In order to instruct
the children in the many katchinas of the Hopi pantheon,
<i>tih&ucirc;s</i>, or dolls, are made in imitation of the
ancestral supernal beings, and these quaint and curious
toys are eagerly sought after by those interested in
Indian life and thought. Dr. Fewkes has in his private
collection over two hundred and fifty different katchina
tih&ucirc;s, and in the Field Columbian Museum there is an
even larger collection.</p>

<p>Of the altars, screens, fetishes, cloud-blowers, ceremonial
pipes, bull-roarers, etc., I have not space here
to write. Suffice it to say they have a large place in
the Hopi's ritual and all should be carefully studied.</p>

<p>When I first began to visit the Hopis my camps were
generally at the foot of the trail, as near to water as
possible. Every morning at a very early hour I was
awakened by a loud ringing of cowbells, and at first
I thought it must be that the Hopis had a herd of
cows and they were driving them out to pasture. They
were evidently going at a good speed, for the bells
clanged and clattered and jangled as if being fiercely
shaken. But when I looked for the cows they were
never to be seen. Then, too, as on succeeding mornings
I listened I found the animals must be driven very
hastily, for the sound moved with great rapidity towards,
past, away from me.</p>

<p>One morning I determined to get up and watch as
soon as I heard the noise approaching. It was just
as the earliest premonitions of dawn were being given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
that I was awakened, and, hurriedly jumping up, stood
on my blankets and watched. Soon one, two, four, and
more figures darted by in the dim light, each carrying
a jangling cowbell, and to my amazement I found they
were not cows, but Hopi young men, naked except
for a strap or girdle around the loins, from which hung
the bell, resting upon the haunch. They were out for
their morning run, and it was not merely a physical
exercise, but had a distinct religious meaning to them.
As I have elsewhere written:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Hopi has lived for many centuries among the
harsh conditions of the desert land. Everything is
wrested from nature. Nothing is given freely, as in
such a land as southern California for instance. Water
is scarce and has to be caught in the valley and carried
with heavy labor to the mesa summit. The soil is
sandy and not very productive unless every particle of
seed corn is watered by irrigation. Firewood is far
away and must be cut and brought to their mesa homes
with labor. Wild grass seeds must be sought where
grass abounds, perhaps scores of miles away, and carried
home. Pinion nuts can only be gathered in the
pinion forests afar off, and to gain mescal the pits must
be dug and the fibres cooked deep down in the mysterious
recesses of the Grand Canyon. The deer and
antelope are swift, and can only be caught for food by
those who are stout of limb, powerful of lung, and crafty
of mind. Hence in the very necessities of their lives
they have found the use for physical development.
And this imperative physical need soon graduated into
a spiritual one. And the steps or processes of reasoning
by which the chief motive is transferred from the physical
to the spiritual are readily traceable. Of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
they are a 'chosen people.' 'Those Above' have given
especial favors to them. They must be a credit to
those Powers who have thus favored them. This implies
a steady cultivation of their muscular powers.
Not to be strong is to be a bad Hopi, and to be a bad
Hopi is to court the disfavor of the gods. Hence the
shamans or priests urge the religious necessity of being
swift and strong."</p>

<p>Nor is this all. In days gone by they were surrounded
by predatory foes. Physical endurance was
an essential condition of national preservation. Without
it they would long ago have been starved or hunted
out of existence. The gods called upon them to preserve
their national life, to live by cultivation of endurance,
hence the imposition of physical tasks as a
religious exercise.</p>

<p>And these morning runs of the young men were of
ten, twenty, and even more miles, taken without any
other food than a few grains of parched corn.</p>

<p>It is no uncommon thing for an Oraibi or Mashonganavi
to run from his home to Moenkopi, a distance of
forty miles, over the hot blazing sands of a real American
Sahara, there hoe his corn-field, and return to his
home, within twenty-four hours. The accompanying
photograph of an old man who had made this eighty-mile
run was made the morning after his return, and he
showed not the slightest trace of fatigue.</p>

<p>For a dollar I have several times engaged a young
man to take a message from Oraibi to Keam's Canyon,
a distance of seventy-two miles, and he has run on foot
the whole distance, delivered his message, and brought
me an answer within thirty-six hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>One Oraibi, Ku-wa-wen-ti-wa, ran from Oraibi to
Moenkopi, thence to Walpi, and back to Oraibi, a distance
of over ninety miles, in one day.</p>

<p>When I was a lad I got the impression somehow that
Indians made fire by rubbing two sticks together.
Once or twice I tried it. I got two sticks, perfectly dry,
and rubbed and rubbed and rubbed. But the more I
rubbed, the cooler the sticks seemed to get. I got hot,
but that had no effect on the sticks.</p>

<p>Later in life, when I began to make my journeys of
exploration in the wilds of Nevada, California, Arizona,
and New Mexico, and I sometimes needed a fire, and
didn't have a single match left, I tried it again; this
time not as an experiment, but as a serious proposition.
My rubbing of the two sticks, however, never availed
me a particle. I might as well have saved my strength
for sawing wood. Yet the Indians do get fire by the
rubbing of two sticks together, and the occasion of their
doing it is one of the greatest and most wonderful of
the religious ceremonies of the Hopis. Dr. Fewkes has
written for the scientific world a full account of it, and
from that account I condense the following.</p>

<p>Few white men have ever seen the ceremony, and did
they do so and tell the whole of what they saw they
would not be believed.</p>

<p>Four societies of priests conduct the elaborate rite at
Walpi. It is not held at Sichumavi or Hano, but is
conducted at Oraibi and the three villages of the middle
mesa. "The public dances are conducted mainly by
two of the societies, whose actions are of a phallic nature.
These two act as chorus in the kiva when the fire is
made, but the sacred flame is kindled by the latter two
societies.... For several days before the ceremony began,
large quantities of wood were piled near the kiva<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
hatches, and after the rites began, this fuel was carried
down into the rooms and continually fed to the flames
of the new fire by an old man, who never left his task.
The flames of the new fire were regarded with reverence;
no one was allowed to light a cigarette from it or
otherwise profane it."</p>

<p>On the first day the chiefs assembled for their ceremonial
smoke, and the next day at early dawn one of them
went to the narrow portion of the mesa between Walpi
and Sichumavi and laid on the trail one of the puhtabi,
or long strings, elsewhere described, sprinkling a little
meal and casting a pinch toward the place of sunrise.
At the same time he said a prayer: "Our Sun, send us
rain." Just as the sun appeared he "cried" the announcement,
of which Dr. Fewkes gives the free
translation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"All people awake, open your eyes, arise!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Become <i>Talahoya</i> (Child of Light), vigorous, active, sprightly.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Let the women be ready to pour water upon them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That moisture may come in abundance and all shall rejoice."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Four days later, with elaborate preparation and carefully
observed ritual the new fire was made. About
a hundred participants were present. When all were
ready the fire-board was held in position by two
kneeling men, while two others manipulated the fire
drill. The singing chief then gave the signal and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
two societies started a song, each with different words
and yet in unison, accompanied by clanging of bells and
rattling of tortoise shells and deer hoofs. The holes
of the fire-board and stones were sprinkled with corn
pollen. The spindle or fire drill was held vertically
between the palms, and in rotating it the top was
pressed downward. Smoke was produced in twenty
seconds and a spark of fire in about a minute. The
spark smudged cedar-bark, which was put in place to
catch it, and then the driller blew it into a flame. This
flame was then carried to a pile of greasewood placed in
the fireplace, and as the wood blazed to the ceiling the
song ceased. Prayer was then offered by one of the
chief priests of one of the societies and ceremonial
offerings sprinkled into the fire. This priest was followed
by one from each of the other societies and by
individual worshippers.</p>

<p>They then, in procession, paid a ceremonial visit to
the shrine of the Goddess of Germs, which is among
the rocks at the southwestern point of the mesa. It is
made of flat stones set on edge, opened above and on
one side, and consists of a fetish of petrified wood.</p>

<p>Then followed a complex series of ceremonies that
merely to outline would require several pages. Some
of them are public dances, others dramatic representations
in a crude fashion of what the legends of the
Hopis say are certain events which transpired in the
underworld, and a most important one is the disposal
of the sacred embers of the new fire.</p>

<p>There are few ceremonies in the world that equal in
solemnity and interest, and that are more charming, than
those performed by the parents and other relatives when
a Hopi baby comes into the world. There are religion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
affection, sentiment, and poetry embraced in what we&mdash;the
superior people&mdash;would undoubtedly term the
superstitious rites of these simple-hearted people. One
reason for the fervor of this rite is the genuine welcome
every Hopi mother and father accord to their baby
when it is born. It is "good form" among them to be
proud of the birth of their children. No married woman
is happy unless she has a "quiver full" of children, and
one of her constant prayers before her marriage is that
she may be thus blessed.</p>

<p>So when the child comes there is great rejoicing. It
is immediately rubbed all over with ashes to keep the
hair from growing on the body; or that, at least, is the
reason the Hopi mother gives for allowing her little one
to be scrubbed all over with the ashes.</p>

<p>Then it is wrapped up in a cotton blanket of the
mother's own weaving, for Hopi women, and men also,
are great experts in growing, spinning, and weaving
cotton. Now it is ready for the cradle. This is either
a piece of board or a flat piece of woven wicker-work
about two and a half feet long and a foot wide.
There is also fixed at the upper end two or three twigs
arranged in a kind of bow, so that a piece of cloth thrown
over them forms an awning to protect the face of the
child from the sun. When this bow is not in use it can
be slipped over to the back of the cradle. Strapped in
this queer cradle, the baby is either stretched out upon
the ground to go to sleep, covered over with a blanket,
or reared up against the wall. But if your eyes were
keen you would see by its side a beautiful white
ear of corn. And if you saw it and knew the Hopi
mother's ways and her thoughts, you would find that the
reason for putting the corn there was this: she believes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
that the corn represents one of her most powerful gods
on the earth, and that if this god is made to feel kindly
towards the new-born child he will send it good health
and strength and skill in hunting and everything else
that she desires for her loved baby. So, you see, it is
mother love, combined with a singular superstition, that
makes the Hopi mother place the ear of corn by the
side of her sleeping child.</p>

<p>When the baby is twenty days old it is&mdash;shall I say?&mdash;baptized.
You can hardly call it this, but, anyhow,
it answers the same thing as baptism does with us.
About sunset the child's godmother arrives. She is
generally the grandmother or aunt on the father's side.
Just as the first streaks of light begin to come in the
early morning the ceremony begins. After washing the
mother's head and legs and feet, the baby's turn comes.
The house is full of relatives and friends to watch and
bring good fortune to the little one. A bowl of suds is
made by beating the soapweed until the water is covered
with beautiful lather. Then the godmother takes an ear
of corn, dips it into the suds, and touches the baby's
head with it. This she does four times. Then she
washes the baby's head very carefully and thoroughly
in the suds. But the washing would be of no good
unless all the baby's female relatives on the father's side
were to dip their ears of corn into the suds and touch
its head with them four times, just as the godmother
did. Now the baby is washed all over, and then&mdash;strange
to say&mdash;the godmother fills her mouth full of
warm water, and, balancing the baby on one hand, she
squirts the water from her mouth all over the little one.
To dry it, she holds it before the fire, and when it is
quite dry she rubs it with white corn-meal, wraps it in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
blanket, and passes it over to the mother, who is seated
near to the fire. Just before her are two baskets full
of corn-meal, one coarsely and one finely ground.
Taking an old blanket, the godmother spreads it over
the mother's lap, the baby is placed on it, then she takes
a little of the fine meal and rubs it on the face, arms, and
neck of the mother, and also upon the face of the child.
Then with the ear of corn in her hand, and slowly and
regularly moving it up and down, she prays first over
the mother, then over the baby. I have heard several
of these prayers. Here is one of them: "Ho-ko-na
(butterfly), I ask for you that you live to be old, that
you may never be sick, that you may have good corn
and all good things. And now I name you Ho-ko-na"
(or whatever the name is to be).</p>

<p>Then every woman and girl of the father's relatives
does just the same and prays the same kind of prayer;
but singular to us is the fact that each one gives the
child any name she prefers. As each one finishes her
prayer, she gives her ear of corn and some sacred meal
she has brought with her to the mother, who invariably
responds with the Hopi "Thank you!"&mdash;"Es-kwa-li."</p>

<p>Nobody knows at the time which name the baby will
have, as he or she grows up. That is left to chance to
determine&mdash;generally the preference of the mother.</p>

<p>Now the baby is put in its cradle, with some of the
ears of corn presented to the mother placed under the
lacing on the breast of the little one, and it is ready to
be dedicated to the sun. After sweeping the floor, the
godmother sprinkles a line of meal about two inches
wide from the cradle to the door, and the mother does
the same thing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Out of doors the father is anxiously watching for the
first direct light of the sun, and the moment it appears
above the horizon he gives the signal. Immediately the
godmother picks up the cradle, so that the baby's head
is towards the door, and near to the floor, carries it over
the line of sacred meal, the mother following. Each
has a handful of meal. At the door they stand side by
side. The godmother removes the blanket from the
baby's face, holds the sacred meal to her mouth, says
a short prayer, and then sprinkles the meal towards the
sun, and then the mother does the same; and, after
ceremonially feeding the baby, all joining in the feast,
the ceremony is at an end.</p>

<p>Another most beautiful ceremony of the Hopis is that
which alternates with the Snake Dance, viz., the Lelentu,
or Flute Dance. I have had the pleasure of witnessing
it several times, and last year (1901) was one of five
white persons present. To me this meant walking a
weary thirteen miles over the hot sands of the Painted
Desert, carrying a camera weighing about fifty pounds
on my back. But the beauty and charm of the ceremony
and the satisfaction of obtaining the photographs
of it more than repaid me for the hot and exhausting
walk.</p>

<p>After the secret kiva ceremonies (rites in the underground
chambers of the fraternity of the Flute) the first
public rites of the day took place at a spring near the
home of Lol&uacute;lomai, the chief of the Oraibi pueblo, and
about five miles west of the town. Here is one of the
pitiful springs upon which the people depend for their
meagre supply of water. Just before noon men, women,
and girls might have been seen wending their way from
the village on the mesa height, down the steep trails,
over the sandy way trodden for centuries by their forefathers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
towards the location of the spring.</p>

<p>Every face was as serious and wore as grave and
earnest an expression as that of a novice about to be
confirmed in her holiest vows. Arrived at the spring,
an eminence just above it to the southwest was the
chosen site for the preliminaries. Here an hour or
more was spent in prayers, sprinkling of meal before
and upon the altar, and the painting of the symbols of
the clan upon the participants.</p>

<p>Other priests during the whole time were on their
knees or in other postures of reverence, praying, singing,
or chanting, and sprinkling the sacred meal on or
before the altar. A large number of bahos, or prayer
sticks and plumes, were used.</p>

<p>At this time the chief priest left the hillside and
solemnly marched down to the spring. It is circular in
shape, and with a rude wall built around it. At the
opening in the circle three small gourd vessels were
placed, two of which held sacred water from some far-away
spring, and the other was full of honey. A singular
thing occurred about the filling of this honey jar. A
nest of bees had located in the wall of the spring, and
the chief priest, taking it for granted that this was a
good sign, had the nest dug out and the honey extracted
from the comb, for his sacred purposes. After
he had prayed for a while the priests and women from
above marched down, all except the flute players. As
they stood around the spring they sang and prayed,
while the chief priest stepped into the water, bowing his
face down over it, and waving his tiponi in and through
it. Soon it was a filthy, muddy mess, instead of a water
spring, and when it seemed mixed up enough he began
to dip his face deep into it, while the men and women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
around continued their singing and worship.</p>

<p>Then he came forth, and now began a most beautiful
processional march around the spring, in time to the
weird playing of the priests above. After three times
circling around, the group stood, facing the west, and
at certain signals sprinkled large handfuls of sacred
meal in the direction of the water. This was followed
by a most profuse scattering of bahos in the same manner.
Literally hundreds of them were thus thrown, and
I gathered (after the celebrants were gone) scores of
them for my collection. The bahos used on this occasion
were mere downy feathers to which cotton strings
were attached. The effect as the meal and the feathers
were thrown was remarkably beautiful, and the scene
was most impressive; none the less so for its strangeness
and peculiarity.</p>

<p>These concluded the ceremonies at this spring. In
the meantime the chief priest had gone to his house
over the hill, and from there had started out a group of
young men who were to race to the spring near the
mesa&mdash;four miles away. It was a scorching hot day&mdash;as
I had found out in my own walk&mdash;and yet these
young men bounded over the sandy trail like hunted
deer. It was a glorious sight to witness them. Ten or
a dozen athletic youths, clad scantily, their bronzed
figures in perfect proportion, revealing their strength
and power, their long black hair waving out behind
them, darting off like strings from a bow across the
desert.</p>

<p>Slowly we followed them, and when we arrived at the
other spring found they had long ago passed it, and
the victor had received his reward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>Similar ceremonies were gone through at the near-by
spring as at the one farther away, and when they were
completed the whole party formed in procession, and
as solemnly as if it were a funeral march proceeded
up the steep trail to the village and there repeated some
of the ceremonies already described.</p>

<p>The purport of all this it is comparatively easy to
understand. The Snake Dance is a prayer for rain,
which, according to the Hopi's ideas, is stored in vast
reservoirs in the heavens. He also believes that there
are vast water supplies under the earth, and so, every
other year, he petitions the powers that govern and control
these subterranean reservoirs to loosen the waters
and let them flow forth into the springs.</p>

<p>In one of the dances of the Navaho they symbolize
the water from above and the water from below by linking
the first fingers together. This gives us the Greek
fret, and when this symbol is copied in their basketry,
we see this classic design, purely the result of imitation,
and having as clear a meaning to the Indian mind as the
cross has to the Christian.</p>

<p>Reluctantly I am compelled to omit a brief account
of the Basket Dance, which, however, I have partially
described in my book on "Indian Basketry."</p>

<p>The Hopis have very clear and distinct conceptions
of a spirit life beyond the grave. It is not the "happy
hunting-ground," though, to which the general ideas of
the whites consign them. Theirs is a world of spirits,
with some advantages over the world of human beings,
but where life is very similar to what it was on earth.
There is neither punishment awarded for wrong done on
earth, nor reward for good living. It is simply a continuation
of previous existences. When a child is born
the spirit is supposed to come from the underworld<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
through an opening in the earth's crust called <i>Shi-p&aacute;-pu</i>,
and when the grown man dies his spirit returns thither.
His body is buried in a cleft of the rocks on the mesa
side, a mile or so away from the village. The body is
wrapped up and placed in the rocky grave, and then
covered with loose rocks. Food and drink are placed on
the grave, so that when the spirit ascends from the body
and begins its long journey to <i>Shi-p&aacute;-pu</i> and thence
to the underworld, it may have food wherewith to gain
strength. The curious visitor will also notice the baho
which is thrust between the rocks until it touches the
body. Another baho touching this upright one is placed
on the grave pointing toward the southwest. These
bahos are especially prepared by the shaman, or "medicine
man," and are for the purpose of guiding the spirit
as it leaves the body. If no baho were there, the spirit
might grope in darkness, trying to force its way down;
but, being directed by the prayers of the shaman, the
disembodied spirit immediately realizes the guiding
power of the baho, and, following it, reaches the companion
baho pointing to the southwest, the direction it
must travel to reach the entrance to the underworld.
This entrance to the underworld was long thought to
be in the San Francisco Mountains near Flagstaff. But
Dr. Fewkes explains this to be an error. The <i>Shi-p&aacute;-pu</i>
is, to the Hopi, the "sun-house or place of sunset at the
winter solstice. As seen from Walpi, the entrance to
the sun-house is indicated by a notch on the horizon
situated between the San Francisco range and the
Eldon mesa," hence the conception that the entrance
to the underworld was in that exact location.</p>

<small>THE HOPI SNAKE DANCE</small></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="smcap">hile</span> perhaps no more important than others of
the many ceremonies of the Hopis, the Snake
Dance is by far the widest known and most exciting
and thrilling to the spectator. There have been many
accounts of it written, yet no less an authority than Dr.
Jesse Walter Fewkes of the Smithsonian Institution
asserts that the major portion of them are not worth the
paper they are written on. Inaccurate in outline, faulty
in detail, they utterly fail, in the most part, to grasp the
deep importance of the ceremony to the religious Hopis.
It is commonly described as a wild, chaotic, yelling,
shouting, pagan dance, instead of the solemn dignified
rite it is. From various articles of my own written at
different times I mainly extract the following account
and explanations.</p>

<p>This dance alternates in each village with the Lelentu,
or Flute ceremony, so that, if the visitor goes on successive
years to the same village, he will see one year
the Snake Dance and on the following year the Lelentu.
But if he alternates his visits to the different villages he
may see the Snake Dance every year, and, as the ceremonies
are not all held simultaneously, he may witness
the open-air portion of the ceremony, which is the Snake
Dance proper, three times on the even years and twice on
the odd years. For instance, in the year 1905 it will
occur at Walpi and Mashonganavi; and in 1906 at Oraibi,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Shipauluvi, and Shungopavi.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span class="smcap">The Beginning of the Hopi Snake Dance,
Oraibi</span>, 1902.</p>

<p>The Hopis are keen observers of all celestial and terrestrial
phenomena, and, as soon as the month of
August draws near, the Snake and Antelope fraternities
meet in joint session to determine, by the meteorological
signs with which they are familiar, the date upon
which the ceremonies shall begin.</p>

<p>This decided, the public crier is called upon to make
the announcement to the whole people. Standing on
the house-top, in a peculiarly monotonous and yet jerky
shout he announces the time when the elders have
decided the rites shall commence. Sometimes, as at
Walpi, this announcement is made sixteen days before
the active ceremonies begin, the latter, in all the villages,
lasting nine days and terminating in the popularly
known open-air dance, after which four days of feasting
and frolic are indulged in, thus making, in all, twenty
days devoted to the observance.</p>

<p>For all practical purposes, however, nine days cover
all the ceremonies connected with it.</p>

<p>At Walpi, on the first of the nine days, the first ceremony
consists of the "setting up" of the Antelope altar.
This is an interesting spectacle to witness, as at Walpi
the altar is more elaborate and complex than in any other
village. It consists, for the greater part, of a mosaic
made of different colored sands, in the use of which
some of the Hopis are very dexterous. These sands are
sprinkled on the floor. First a border is made of several
parallel rows or lines of different colors. Within this
border clouds are represented, below which four zigzag
lines are made. These lines figure the lightning, which
is the symbol of the Antelope fraternity. Two of these
zigzags are male, and two female, for all things, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
inanimate, have sex among this strange people. In the
place of honor, on the edge of the altar, is placed the
"tiponi," or palladium of the fraternity. This consists
of a bunch of feathers, fastened at the bottom with
cotton strings to a round piece of cottonwood. Corn
stalks, placed in earthenware jars, are also to be seen,
and then the whole of the remaining three sides of the
altar are surrounded by crooks, to which feathers are
attached, and bahos, or prayer sticks. It was with
trepidation I dared to take my camera into the mystic
depths of the Antelope kiva. I had guessed at focus
for the altar, and when I placed the camera against the
wall, pointed toward the sacred place, the Antelope
priests bid me remove it immediately. I begged to
have it remain so long as I stayed, but was compelled
to promise I would not place my head under the black
cloth and look at the altar. This I readily promised,
but at the first opportunity when no one was between
the lens and the altar, I quietly removed the cap from
the lens, marched away and sat down with one of the
priests, while the dim light performed its wonderful
work on the sensitive plate. A fine photograph was the
result.</p>

<p>The ceremonies of the Antelope kiva for the succeeding
days consist of the making of bahos, or prayer sticks,
ceremonial smoking, praying, and singing. But the
profound ritualistic importance attached to every act
can scarcely be estimated by those who have not personally
seen the ceremonies. The prayer sticks are
prayed over and consecrated at every step in their
manufacture, and the altar is prayed over and blessed
each day. Every object used is consecrated with
elaborate ritual, and the great smoke is made by each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
one solemnly participating in the smoking of <i>&oacute;mow&ucirc;h</i>
(the sacred pipe). The smoke from this pipe soon fills
the chamber with its pleasant fragrance (the tobacco
used being a weed native to the Hopi region), and it is
supposed to ascend to the heavens and thus provoke
the descent of the rain.</p>

<p>The songs are sung to the accompaniment of rattling
by the priests, and each day the whole of the sixteen
songs are rendered.</p>

<p>During the singing of one day one of the priests
strikes the floor with a blunt instrument, and Wiki, the
chief priest, explained this as the sending of a mystic
message to a member of the Snake-Antelope fraternity at
far-away Acoma, telling him that the ceremonies were
now in progress and asking him to come. Strange to
say, eight days later, certain Acomas did come, thus
giving color to the assertion of the Hopi fraternities that
the Snake Dance once used to be performed on the
glorious penyol height of Acoma, as was briefly stated
by Espejo.</p>

<p>It is in the Snake kiva that the snake charm liquid is
made. In the centre of a special altar a basket made
by a Havasupai Indian is placed. In this are dropped
some shells, charms, and a few pieces of crushed nuts
and sticks. Then one of the priests, with considerable
ritual, pours into the basket from north, west, south,
east, up and down (the six cardinal points of the Hopi),
liquid from a gourd vessel. By this time all the priests
are squatted around the basket, chewing something that
one of the older priests had given them. This chewed
substance is then placed in the liquid of the basket.
Water from gourds on the roof is also put in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Then all is ready for the preparation of the charm.
Each priest holds in his hand the snake whip (a stick to
which eagle feathers are attached), while the ceremonial
pipe-lighter, after lighting the sacred pipe, hands it to the
chief priest, addressing him in terms of relationship.
Smoking it in silence, the chief puffs the smoke into the
liquid and hands it to his neighbor, who does the like and
passes it on. All thus participate in solemn silence.</p>

<p>Then the chief priest picks up his rattle and begins a
prayer which is as fervent as one could desire. Shaking
the rattle, all the priests commence to sing a weird song
in rapid time, while one of them holds upright in the
middle of the basket a black stick, on the top of which
is tied a feather. Moving their snake whips to and fro,
they sing four songs, when one of the chiefs picks up all
the objects on the altar and places them in the basket.</p>

<p>In a moment the kiva rings with the fierce yells of the
Hopi war-cry, while the priest vigorously stirs the
mixture in the basket. And the rapid song is sung
while the priest stirs and kneads the contents of the
basket with his hands. Sacred meal is cast into the
mixture, while the song sinks to low tones, and gradually
dies away altogether, though the quiet shaking of the
rattles and gentle tremor of the snake whips continue
for a short time.</p>

<p>Then there is a most painful silence. The hush is
intense, the stillness perfect. It is broken by the prayer
of the chief priest, who sprinkles more sacred meal into
the mixture. Others do the same. The liquid is again
stirred, and then sprinkled to all the cardinal points, and
the same is done in the air outside, above the kiva.</p>

<p>Then the stirring priest takes some white earth, and
mixing it with the charm liquid, makes white paint
which he rubs upon the breast, back, cheeks, forearms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
and legs of the chief priest. All the other priests are
then likewise painted.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span class="smcap">Throwing the Snakes into the Circle of Sacred Meal.</span></p>

<p>Now there is nothing whatever in this liquid that can
either charm a snake or preserve an Indian from the
deadly nature of its bite. Even the Hopis know that all
its virtue is communicated in the ceremonies I have so
imperfectly and inadequately described. I make this
explanation lest my reader assume that there is some
subtle poison used in this mixture, which, if given to the
snakes, stupefies them and renders them unable to do
injury.</p>

<p>The singing of the sixteen songs referred to is a most
solemn affair. Snake and Antelope priests meet in the
kiva of the latter. The chief priests take their places
at the head of the altar, and the others line up on either
side, the Snake priests to the left, the Antelope to the
right. Kneeling on one knee, the two rows of men,
with naked bodies, solemn faces, bowed heads, no voice
speaking above a whisper, demand respect for their
earnestness and evident sincerity. To one unacquainted
with their language and the meaning of the songs, the
weird spectacle of all these nude priests, kneeling and
solemnly chanting in a sonorous humming manner, their
voices occasionally rising in a grand crescendo, speedily
to diminish in a thrilling pianissimo, produces a seriousness
wonderfully akin to the spirit of worship.</p>

<p>According to the legendary lore of the Snake clan
the Zunis, Hopis, Paiutis, Havasupais, and white men
all made their ascent from the lower world to the earth's
surface through a portion of Pis-is-bai-ya (the Grand
Canyon of the Colorado River) near where the Little
Colorado empties into the main river. As the various
families emerged, some went north and some south.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Those that went north were driven back by fierce cold
which they encountered, and built houses for themselves
at a place called To-ko-n&aacute;-bi. But, unfortunately, this
was a desert place where but little rain fell, and their
corn could not grow. In their pathetic language the
Hopis say, "The clouds were small and the corn weak."
The chief of the village had two sons and two daughters.
The oldest of these sons, Tiyo, resolved to commit himself
to the waters of the Colorado River, for they, he
was convinced, would convey him to the underworld,
where he could learn from the gods how always to be
assured of their favor.</p>

<p>(This idea of the Colorado River flowing to the
underworld is interesting as illustrative of Hopi reasoning.
They said, and still say, this water flows from the
upperworld in the far-away mountains, it flows on and
on and never returns, therefore it must go to the inner
recesses of the underworld.)</p>

<p>Tiyo made for himself a kind of coffin boat from the
hewed-out trunk of a cottonwood tree. Into this he
sealed himself and was committed to the care of the
raging river. His rude boat dashed down the rapids,
over the falls, into the secret bowels of the earth (for
the Indians still believe the river disappears under the
mountainous rocks), and finally came to a stop. Tiyo
looked out of his peepholes and saw the Spider Woman,
who invited him to leave his boat and enter her house.
The Spider Woman is a personage of great power in
Hopi mythology. She it is who weaves the clouds in
the heavens, and makes the rain possible. Tiyo accepted
the invitation, entered her house, and received from her
a powder which gave him the power to become invisible
at will. Following the instructions of the Spider Woman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
he descended the hatch-like entrance to Shi-p&aacute;-pu, and
soon came to the chamber of the Snake-Antelope people.
Here the chief received him with great cordiality, and
said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I cause the rain clouds to come and go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I make the ripening winds to blow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I direct the going and coming of all the mountain animals.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before you return to the earth you will desire of me many things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Freely ask of me and you shall abundantly receive."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>For a while he wandered about in the underworld,
learning this and that, here and yonder, and at last returned
to the Snake-Antelope and Snake kivas. Here
he learned all the necessary ceremonies for making the
rain clouds come and go, the ripening winds to blow,
and to order the coming and going of the animals.
With words of affection the chief bestowed upon him
various things from both the kivas, such as material of
which the snake kilt was to be made, with instructions
as to its weaving and decoration, sands to make the
altars, etc. Then he brought to Tiyo two maidens,
both of whom knew the snake-bite charm liquid, and
instructed him that one was to be his wife and the
other the wife of his brother, to whom he must convey
her in safety. Then, finally, he gave to him the
"tiponi," the sacred standard, and told him, "This is
your mother. She must ever be protected and revered.
In all your prayers and worship let her be at the head
of your altar or your words will not reach Those Above."</p>

<p>Tiyo now started on his return journey. When he
reached the home of the Spider Woman, she bade him
and the maidens rest while she wove a pannier-like
basket, deep and narrow, with room to hold all three of
them. When the basket was finished she saw them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
comfortably seated, told them not to leave the basket, and
immediately disappeared through the hatch into the
lower world. Tiyo and the maidens waited, until slowly
a filament gently descended from the clouds, attached
itself to the basket, and then carefully and safely drew
Tiyo and the maidens to the upperworld. Tiyo gave
the younger maiden to his brother, and then announced
that in sixteen days he would celebrate the marriage
feast. Then he and his betrothed retired to the
Snake-Antelope kiva, while his brother and the other maiden
retired to the Snake kiva. On the fifth day after the
announcement the Snake people from the underworld
came to the upperworld, went to the kivas, and ate corn
pollen for food. Then they left the kivas and
disappeared. But Tiyo and the maidens knew that they
had only changed their appearance, for they were in the
valley in the form of snakes and other reptiles. So he
commanded his people to go into the valleys and capture
them, bring them to the kivas and wash them and
then dance with them. Four days were spent in catching
them from the four world quarters; then, with
solemn ceremony, they were washed, and, while the
prayers were offered, the snakes listened to them, so
that when, at the close of the dance, where they danced
with their human brothers, they were taken back to the
valley and released, they were able to return to the
underworld and carry to the gods there the petitions
that their human brothers had uttered upon the earth.</p>

<p>This, in the main, is the snake legend. The catching
of the snakes foreshadowed in the snake legend is
faithfully carried out each year by the Snake men. After
earnest prayer, each man is provided with a hoe, a snake
whip, consisting of feathers tied to two sticks, a sack of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
sacred meal (corn-meal especially prayed and smoked
over by the chief priest), and a small buckskin bag, and
on the fourth day after the setting up of the Antelope
altar they go out to the north for the purpose of catching
the snakes. Familiarity from childhood with the
haunts of the snakes, which are never molested, enables
them to go almost directly to places where they may be
found. As soon as a reptile is seen, prayers are offered,
sacred meal sprinkled upon him, the snake whip gently
stroked upon him, and then he is seized and placed in
the bag. In the evening the priests return and deposit
their snakes in a large earthenware olla provided for the
occasion. I should have noted that before they go out
their altar is erected. This varies in the different villages,
the most complete and perfect altar being at
Walpi. At Oraibi the altar consists of the two wooden
images&mdash;the little war gods&mdash;named P&#369;-&#369;-kon-hoy-a
and Pal-un-hoy-a; and in 1898 I succeeded, with considerable
difficulty, in getting into the Snake kiva and
making a fairly good photograph of these gods.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span class="smcap">Line-up of Snake and Antelope Priests,
Antelope Dance, Oraibi</span>, 1902.</p>

<p>The catching of the snakes occupies four days, one
day for each of the four world quarters.</p>

<p>At near sunset of the eighth day a public dance of
the Antelope priests takes place in the plaza, similar in
many respects to the Snake Dance, except that corn
stalks are carried by the priests instead of snakes.</p>

<p>On the morning of the ninth day the race of the
young men occurs. This is an exciting scene. Long
before sunrise the Hopis, and as many visitors as have
climbed the mesa heights, huddle together or sleepily
sit watching a point far off in the desert. It is from
that region&mdash;one of the springs&mdash;the racers are to
come. Soon they are seen in the far-away distance as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
tiny specks, moving over the tawny sand, and scarcely
distinguishable. One morning I stayed below at the
spring on the western side of the mesa to watch them.
The whole line of the mesa-top ruled an irregular but
clearly defined line against the morning sky. The air
was clear and pure, sweet and cool. From the Gap to
the end of the mesa upon which Walpi stands crowds
of spectators were silhouetted against the sky. The
background, seen from my low angle of vision, was a
pure blue; above, the sky was mottled with white
clouds. On every projecting point which afforded a view
the spectators stood, tiny figures taken from a child's
Noah's Ark, chunky bodies, with a crowning ball of
wood for head. But even at that distance and against
the coming sunlight the brilliant colors of the dresses of
the Indians, men and women, were revealed. Every
note in the gorgeous gamut of color was played in
fantastic and unrestrained melody. At Walpi the spectators
crowded the house-tops, which there overlook the
very edge of the mesa. The point was crowded. The
morning light was just touching the cliffs of the west
when the sound of the coming bells was heard. Jingle,
jingle, jingle, they came, growing in sound at every step.
There was movement among the spectators, each one
craning his neck to see the strenuous efforts of the
runners. Jingle, jingle, jingle, louder and louder, showing
that the strides of these runners are great; they are
making rapid bites at the distance that intervenes between
them and the goal. Now they can be individually
discerned. Their reddish-brown bodies, long black
hair streaming behind, sunflowers crowning some, heaving
chests, tremendous strides, swinging gait, make a
fascinating picture. Now they crowd each other on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
sandy trail. A spurt is being made, and one of the
rear men passes to the front and becomes the leader.
From the mesa heights the shouts and cheers denote
that his success has been observed. Others crowd along.
The spectators become excited and cheer on their
favorites. Now the foot of the steep portion of the
trail is reached. Surely this precipitous ascent will
abate their ardor and slacken their speed. The steps
are high, and it is a rise of several hundred feet to the
mesa-top. The very difficulties seem to spur them on
to greater effort. With bounds like those of deer or
chamois, up they fly, two steps at a time. The pace
and ascent are killing, but they are trained to it, having
spent their lives running over these hot sands and climbing
these trails. To them a "rush" up the mesa heights
is a part of their religious training. The priests are now
ready to receive them at the head of the trail. The first
to arrive is the winner, and he is sprinkled with the
sacred meal and water, and then he hurries on to the
Antelope kiva, where the chief priest gives him bahos,
sacred meal, and an amulet of great power. The other
racers in the meantime have reached the summit, and
I could see their running figures on the narrow neck of
rock which connects Sichumavi with Walpi. They
are going to deposit prayer offerings at an appointed
shrine. On their arrival the race is done.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the racers at the head of the trail
at Mashonganavi, in 1901, I secured a photograph showing
one of the priests shooting out a singular appliance
which represents the lightning.</p>

<p>But on the lower platform of the mesa another exciting
scene is transpiring. A group of young maidens,
with their mothers and sisters, await the coming of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
young men and boys, each of whom carries a corn stalk,
a melon, or a sunflower. As soon as the youths arrive
the maidens dart after them, and for a few minutes a
good-natured but exciting and excitable scuffle goes on,
in which the girls endeavor to seize from the boys the
stalks, etc., they carry.</p>

<p>On the noon of the ninth day the ceremony of washing
the snakes takes place in the Snake kiva.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that only the members of
the fraternity engaged in the ceremonies are permitted
to enter the kivas when the rites are being performed.
Indeed, no other Hopi can be prevailed upon to approach
anywhere near these kivas whilst the symbol
which denotes that the ceremonies are being conducted
is displayed.</p>

<p>Indeed, he believes that his profaning foot will immediately
produce the most awful effects upon his body.
At one kiva he will swell up and "burst"; at another,
a great horn will grow out from his forehead and he
will die in horrible agonies. The first time I was permitted
to see this ceremony at Walpi was while Kopeli
was alive. Kopeli was a Hopi of great power and
ability in a variety of ways, who had a broad way of
looking at things, and was very friendly with the white
men who came in the proper spirit to study the life of
his people. I had been allowed to see all the earlier
of the secret kiva ceremonies, but when the day arrived
on which the snakes were to be washed in the kiva,
Kopeli was especially concerned on my behalf. He said:
"So far 'Those Above' have not found any fault, and
you have not been harmed in the kiva; but to-day
we wash the snakes. You will surely be in danger
if you gaze upon the 'elder brothers.'" Placing my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
arm around his lithe body, I gave Kopeli an unexpected
dig in the stomach. Then I said, quite solemnly:
"Kopeli, your stomach is a Hopi one; you swell up
and bust easy. But feel of me"&mdash;and, taking his
thumb, I gave myself a "dig" with it <i>upon a solid
pocketbook</i> which I carried in my vest pocket. "Do
you feel that?" I asked. "Yes," he replied. "And
you sabe white man's steam-engine, Kopeli, down on
the railroad?" "Yes! I sabe." "Well," said I, "that
steam-engine is made of boiler-iron, and <i>I am all same
boiler-iron inside</i>. I no bust!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="snake">

</a></div>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span class="smcap">The Snake Dance at Oraibi</span>, 1902.</p>

<p>With a merry twinkle in his eye, that showed he
appreciated the joke, he said, "Mabbe so! You no
bust; you stay!" And I stayed.</p>

<p>This washing ceremony is a purely ceremonial observance.
The priests have ceremonially washed themselves,
but their snake brothers are unable to do this,
hence they must have it done for them.</p>

<p>In the underground kiva, hewn out of the solid rock&mdash;a
place some sixteen feet square&mdash;squat or sit the
thirty-four or five priests. I was allowed to take my
place right among them and to join in the singing.
When all was ready the chief priest reverently uttered
prayer, followed by another priest, who, after prayer,
started the singing. Three or four of the older priests
were seated around a large bowl full of water brought
from some sacred spring many, many miles away. This
water was blessed by smoking and breathing upon it
and presenting it successively to the powers of the six
world points, north, west, south, east, up and down.</p>

<p>At a given signal two men thrust their hands into
the snake-containing ollas, and drew therefrom one or
two writhing, wriggling reptiles. These they handed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
to the priests of the sacred water. All this time the
singing, accompanied by the shaking of the rattles,
continued. As the snakes were dipped again and again
into the water, the force of the singing increased until
it was a tornado of sound. Suddenly the priests who
were washing the snakes withdrew them from the
water and threw them over the heads of the sitting
priests upon the sand of the sacred altar at the other
end of the room. Simultaneously with the throwing
half of the singing priests ceased their song and burst
out into a blood-curdling yell, "Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ow! Ow!" which is the Hopi war-cry.</p>

<p>Then, in a moment, all was quiet, more snakes were
brought and washed, the singing and rattling beginning
at a pianissimo and gradually increasing to a
quadruple forte, when again the snakes were thrown
upon the altar, with the shrieking voices yelling "Ow!
Ow!" in a piercing falsetto, as before. The effect was
simply horrifying. The dimly lighted kiva, the solemn,
monotonous hum of the priests, the splashing of the
wriggling reptiles in the water, the serious and earnest
countenances of the participants, the throwing of the
snakes, and the wild shrieks fairly raised one's hair, made
the heart stand still, stopped the action of the brain,
sent cold chills down one's spinal column, and made
goose-flesh of the whole of the surface of one's body.</p>

<p>And this continued until fifty, one hundred, and even
as many as one hundred and fifty snakes were thus
washed and thrown upon the altar. It was the duty
of two men to keep the snakes upon the altar, but on
a small area less than four feet square it can well be
imagined the task was no easy or enviable one. Indeed,
many of the snakes escaped and crawled over our feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
and legs.</p>

<p>As soon as all the snakes were washed, all the priests
retired except those whose duty it was to guard the
snakes. Then it was that I dared to risk taking off
the cap from my lens, pointing it at the almost quiescent
mass of snakes, and trust to good luck for the
result. On another page is the fruition of my faith, in
the first photograph ever made of the snakes of a Hopi
kiva after the ceremony of washing.</p>

<p>And now the sunset hour draws near. This is to
witness the close of the nine days' ceremony. It is to
be public, for the Snake Dance itself is looked upon by
all the people. Long before the hour the house-tops are
lined with Hopis, Navahoes, Paiutis, cow-boys, miners,
Mormons, preachers, scientists, and military men from
Fort Wingate and other Western posts. Here is a
distinguished German savant, and there a representative of
the leading scientific society of France. Yonder is Dr.
Jesse Walter Fewkes, the eminent specialist of the
United States Bureau of Ethnology and the foremost
authority of the world on the Snake Dance, while elbowing
him and pumping him on every occasion is the inquisitive
representative of one of America's leading journals.</p>

<p>See yonder group of interesting maidens. Some
of them are "copper Cleopatras" indeed, and would be
accounted good-looking anywhere. Here is a group
of laughing, frolicking youngsters of both sexes, half of
them stark naked, and, except for the dirt which freely
allies itself to them, perfect little "fried cupids," as
they have not inaptly been described. Now, working
his way through the crowd comes a United States
Congressman, and yonder is the president of a railroad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly a murmur of approval goes up on every
hand. The chief priest of the Antelopes has come out
of the kiva, and he is immediately followed by all the
others; and, as soon as the line is formed, with reverent
mien and stately step, they march to the dance
plaza. Here has been erected a cottonwood bower
called the "kisi," in the base of which ollas have been
placed containing the snakes. In front of this kisi is
a hole covered by a plank. This hole represents the
entrance to the underworld, and now the chief priest
advances toward it, sprinkles a pinch of sacred meal
over it, then vigorously stamps upon it, and marches
on. The whole line do likewise. Four times the
priests circle before the kisi, moving always from right
to left, and stamping upon the meal-sprinkled board as
they come to it. This is to awaken the attention of the
gods of the underworld to the fact that the dance is
about to begin.</p>

<p>Now the Antelope priests line up either alongside or in
front of the kisi&mdash;there being slight and unimportant
variations in this and other regards at the different
villages&mdash;all the while keeping up a solemn and
monotonous humming song or prayer, while they await the
coming of the Snake priests.</p>

<p>At length, with stately stride and rapid movement,
the Snake men come, led by their chief. They go
through the same ceremonies of sprinkling, stamping,
and circling that the Antelope priests did, and then line
up, facing the kisi.</p>

<p>The two lines now for several minutes sing, rattle,
sway their bodies to and fro and back and forth in a most
impressive and interesting manner, until, at a given
signal, the Snake priests break up their line and divide
into groups of three. The first group advances to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
kisi. The first man of the group kneels down and
receives from the warrior priest, who has entered the
kisi, a writhing, wriggling, and, perhaps, dangerous reptile.
Without a moment's hesitation the priest breathes
upon it, puts it between his teeth, rises, and upon his
companion's placing one arm around his shoulders, the
two begin to amble and prance along, followed by the
third member of their group, around the prescribed
circuit. With a peculiar swaying of body, a rapid and
jerky lifting high of one leg, then quickly dropping it and
raising the other, the "carrier" and his "hugger" proceed
about three-fourths of the circuit, when the carrier
drops the snake from his mouth, and passes on to take
his place to again visit the kisi, obtain another snake,
and repeat the performance. But now comes in the
duty of the "gatherer," the third man of the group.
As soon as the snake falls to the ground, it naturally
desires to escape. With a pinch of sacred meal in his
fingers and his snake whip in his hand, the gatherer
rapidly advances, scatters the meal over the snake,
stoops, and like a flash has him in his hands. Sometimes,
however, a vicious rattlesnake, resenting the
rough treatment, coils ready to strike. Now watch the
dexterous handling by a Hopi of a venomous creature
aroused to anger. With a "dab" of meal, the snake
whip is brought into play, and the tickling feathers
gently touch the angry reptile. As soon as he feels
them, he uncoils and seeks to escape. Now is the
time! Quicker than the eye can follow, the expert
"gatherer" seizes the escaping creature, and that excitement
is ended, only to allow the visitor to witness
a similar scene going on elsewhere with other
participants. In the meantime all the snake carriers have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
received their snakes and are perambulating around
as did the first one, so that, until all the snakes are
brought into use, it is an endless chain, composed of
"carrier," snake, "hugger," and "gatherer." Now and
again a snake glides away toward the group of spectators,
and there is a frantic dash to get away. But the
gatherers never fail to stop and capture their particular
reptile. As the dance continues, the gatherers
have more than their hands full, so, to ease themselves,
they hand over their excited and wriggling
victims to the Antelope priests, who, during the whole
of this part of the ceremony, remain in line, solemnly
chanting.</p>

</a></div>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span class="smcap">The Snakes in the Kiva at Mashonganavi,
after the Ceremony of Washing.</span></p>

<p>At last all the snakes have been brought from the
kisi. The chief priest steps forth, describes a circle of
sacred meal upon the ground, and, at a given signal, all
the priests, Snake and Antelope alike, rush up to it, and
throw the snakes they have in hands or mouths into the
circle, at the same time spitting upon them. The
whole of the Hopi spectators, also, no matter where they
may be, reverently spit toward this circle where now
one may see through the surrounding group of priests
the writhing, wriggling, hissing, rattling mass of revolting
reptiles. Never before on earth, except here, was
such a hideous sight witnessed. But one's horror is
kept in abeyance for a while as is heard the prayer of
the chief priest and we see him sprinkle the mass with
sacred meal, while the asperger does the same thing
from the sacred water bowl.</p>

<p>Then another signal is given! Curious spectator,
carried away by your interest, beware! Look out!
In a moment, the Snake priests dart down, "grab" at
the pile of intertwined snakes, get all they can in each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
hand, and then, regardless of your dread, thrust the
snakes into the faces of all who stand in their way, and
like pursued deer dart down the steep and precipitous
trails into the appointed places of the valley beneath.
Here let us watch them from the edge of the mesa.
Reverently depositing them, they kneel and pray over
them and then return to the mesa as hastily as they
descended, divesting themselves of their dance
paraphernalia as they return.</p>

<p>Now occurs one of the strangest portions of the
whole ceremony. The Antelope priests have already
returned, with due decorum, to their kiva. One by one
the Snake men arrive at theirs, sweating and breathless
from their run up the steep trails. When all have
returned, they step to the top of their kiva, or, as at
Walpi, to the western edge of the mesa, and there drink
a large quantity of an emetic that has been especially
prepared for the purpose. Then, O ye gods! gaze on
if ye dare! The whole of them may be seen bending
over, solemnly and in most dignified manner, puking
forth the horrible decoction they have just poured
down. This is a ceremony of internal purification
corresponding to the ceremonial washing of themselves
and the snakes before described. This astounding
spectacle ends as the priests disappear into their kiva,
where they restore their stomachs to a more normal
condition by feasting on the piki, pikami, and other
delicacies the women now bring to them in great quantities.
Then for two days frolic and feasting are indulged
in, and the Snake Dance in that village at least is now
over, to be repeated two years hence.</p>

<p>What is the significance, the real meaning of the Snake
Dance? It is not, as is generally supposed, an act of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
snake worship. Here I can do no more than give the
barest suggestion as to what modern science has concluded.
It is mainly a prayer for rain in which acts of
sun worship are introduced. The propitiation of the
Spider Woman at her shrine by the offerings of prayers
and bahos by the chief Antelope priest demonstrates a
desire for rain. She is asked to weave the clouds, for
without them no rain can descend. The lightning symbol
of the Antelope priests; the shaking of their rattles,
which sounds like the falling rain; the use of the whizzer
to produce the sounds of the coming storm,&mdash;these and
other similar things show the intimate association of the
dance with rain and its making.</p>

<p>Allied to rain are the fructifying processes of the earth;
and as corn is their chief article of food, and its
germination, growth, and maturity depend upon the rainfall,
the use of corn-meal and prayers for the growth of corn
have come to have an important place in the ceremony.</p>

<p>The use of the snakes is for a double purpose. In
celebrating this ceremony it is the desire of the Snake
clan to reproduce the original conditions of its performance
as near as possible, in order to gain all the efficacy
they desire for their petitions. In the original performance
the prayers of the Snake Mother were the potent
ones. Hence the snakes must now be introduced to
make potent prayers.</p>

<p>The other idea is that the snakes act as intermediaries
to convey to the Snake Mother in the underworld
the prayers for rain and corn growth that her children
on the earth have uttered.</p>

<p>In considering the ceremony of the public dance certain
questions naturally arise. Are the Hopis ever
bitten by the venomous snakes, and, if so, what are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
consequences? And what is the secret of their power
in handling these dangerous reptiles with such startling
freedom?</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="emetic">
<img class="border" style="margin-top: 1em;" src="images/image26.jpg" width="600" height="435" alt="After taking the Emetic. Hopi Snake Dance at Walpi." />
</a></div>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span class="smcap">After taking the Emetic. Hopi Snake
Dance at Walpi.</span></p>

<p>There are times when the priests are bitten, but, as
was suggested in the snake legend, they have a snake
venom charm liquid. This is prepared by the chief
woman of the Snake clan, and she and the Snake priest
alone are supposed to know the secret of its composition.
It may be that ere long this secret will be given
to the world by a gentleman who is largely in the confidence
of the Hopis, but, as yet, it is practically unknown.
That it is an antidote there can be no question. I have
seen men seriously bitten by rattlesnakes, and in each
case, after the use of the antidote, the wounded priests
suffered but slightly.</p>

<p>As to the "why" of the handling of the snakes. The
"fact" it is easy to state; but when one enters the realm
of theory to explain the "why" of the fact, he places
himself as a target for others to shoot at. My theory,
however, is that a fear within yourself arouses a
corresponding fear within the reptile. As soon as he feels
fear he prepares to use the weapons of offence and
defence with which nature has provided him.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, you feel no fear, and, in touching
the creature, <i>do not hurt him so as to arouse his fear</i>,
he may be handled with impunity.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, the fact remains&mdash;for I have examined
the snakes before, during, and after the ceremony&mdash;that
dangerous and untampered with rattlesnakes
are used by the Hopis in this, their prayer to
"Those Above" for rain.</p>

<h2><a name="ChVIII." id="ChVIII."></a>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<small>THE NAVAHO AND HIS HISTORY</small></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">M</span><span class="smcap">isunderstood</span>, maligned, abused, despised,
the Navaho has never stood high in the estimation
of those whites who did not know him. Yet he
is industrious, moral, honest, trustworthy, fairly truthful,
religious, and good to his wife and children. Not a
weak list of virtues, even though one has to detract
from it by accusing him of ingratitude. There are noble
exceptions, of course, to this charge, but from what I
know and have seen, I am inclined to believe that many,
if not most, Navahoes have no sense of moral responsibility
for favors and benefits received.</p>

<p>Though, perhaps, not as interesting to study as the
Hopis, there is still a wonderful field open for the student
who is willing to go and live with the Navaho, learn his
language, gain his confidence, participate in all his
ceremonies, and enter into his social and domestic life.</p>

<p>No one has done this as much as Dr. Washington
Matthews, whose "Navaho Legends" is a revelation to
those people who have hitherto held the general ideas
(propagated, too, by a scientific observer) so prevalent
about this long-suffering people.</p>

<p>That the Navaho was reserved with the white man in
the early days of American occupancy there can be no
doubt, and the difficulty experienced in penetrating that
reserve is well exemplified by reference to the letter of
Dr. Joseph Letherman, who lived for three years among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the tribe at Fort Defiance. Aided by Major Kendrick,
who had long commanded at this post, he wrote a letter
which appears in the Smithsonian Report for 1855. In
this he says, among many good things: "Nothing can
be learned of the origin of these people from themselves.
At one time they say they came out of the ground; and
at another, that they know nothing whatever of their
origin; the latter, no doubt, being the truth." Again:
"Of their religion little or nothing is known, as, indeed,
all inquiries tend to show that they have none; and even
have not, we are informed, any word to express the
idea of a Supreme Being. We have not been able to
learn that any observances of a religious character exist
among them; and the general impression of those who
have the means of knowing them is, that, in this respect,
they are steeped in the deepest degradation." Once
more: "They have frequent gatherings for dancing."
And a little further on: "Their singing is but a succession
of grunts, and is anything but agreeable."</p>

<p>One has but to read what Dr. Matthews has written
and gathered from the Navahoes to see how misleading
and erroneous the conclusions of Dr. Letherman were.
To quote: "He [Dr. Matthews] had not been many
weeks in New Mexico when he discovered that the
dances to which the doctor refers were religious
ceremonials, and later he found that these ceremonials
might vie in allegory, symbolism, and intricacy of
ritual with the ceremonies of any people, ancient or
modern. He found, ere long, that these heathens,
pronounced godless and legendless, possessed lengthy
myths and traditions&mdash;so numerous that one can never
hope to collect them all, a pantheon as well stocked
with gods and heroes as that of the ancient Greeks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
and prayers which, for length and vain repetition,
might put a Pharisee to blush."</p>

<p>Wonderful songs also were found, full of poetic
imagery, and suitable for every conceivable occasion,
songs that have been handed down for generations.
Of the sacred songs Dr. Matthews makes the astounding
statement that, "sometimes, pertaining to a single
rite, there are two hundred songs or more which may
not be sung at other rites." Further: "The songs
must be known to the priest of the rite and his assistants
in a most exact manner, for an error made in singing
a song may be fatal to the efficacy of a ceremony. In
no case is an important mistake tolerated, and in some
cases the error of a single syllable works an irreparable
injury."</p>

<p>Popular conceptions of the Navaho are very crude
and inaccurate. They are largely the result of two
"floods of information" which deluged the country at
two epochs in their history, and neither of them had
much truth in the flood. The first of these epochs
was at the discovery of the important cliff dwellings
located on their reservation,&mdash;those of the Tsegi
Canyon (the so-called Canyon de Chelly), Monument
Canyon, Chaco Canyon, etc. Writers who visited the
region wrote the most wild and outrageously conceived
nonsense about this people and the dwellings they were
supposed to look upon with superstitious veneration.
Then later, a lot of unscrupulous whites, fired with
similar zeal to that which led the old conquistadors
across the deserts of northern Mexico and through
the inhospitable wilds of Arizona and New Mexico,&mdash;the
zeal for gold or silver,&mdash;which was doubtless fed by
the fact that the Navahoes did possess thousands of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
dollars' worth of silver ornaments, started out to prospect
the interior recesses of the Navaho reservation.
Knowing by painful experience what this meant,&mdash;for
their "white brothers" had stolen their springs and arable
land from them on the Moenkopi, on the Little Colorado,
at Willow Spring, and a score of other places,&mdash;the
warlike and courageous Navahoes resented the presence
of these men. They begged them to retire, and when
the white men refused, fought and whipped them. This
naturally excited the cupidity of the silver hunters more
than ever. "Why should the blanked Indians fight
if not to protect their silver mines?"&mdash;this was the
kind of question asked, and the natural and legitimate
resentment of the Navahoes was described all over the
country as "another Indian uprising," and led to the
second "flood of knowledge," which the newspapers
always have forthcoming when public interest and
curiosity are aroused.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>Hence the truth often comes as a wet blanket to the
preconceived notions of those who have drank deep
from these earlier streams of information!</p>

<p>Science and legend both agree in giving to the
Navaho a mixed origin. His is not a pure-blooded
race. Their myths or legends refer to many assimilations
of other people, strangers from the North, South,
East, West, and everywhere, all of whom were welcomed
and made an integral part of the nation. Hence there
is no such thing as a distinctly Navaho type, or, as
Hrdlicka puts it, "they show considerable difference
in color and measurement, and cannot be considered a
radically homogeneous people, but their mixture is
not recent." This latter statement is doubtless true,
as they would probably become more clannish as their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
nation grew in numbers and power.</p>

<p>Dr. Matthews gives the stories of the origin of several
of the gentes. One story which he does not relate was
told to me at Tohatchi, and serves to illustrate how a
migration from the Northwest is transformed into a
supernatural occurrence. Though told to me of the
Navahoes as a whole, there can be no doubt that it
applies only to a single gens. The story was in regard
to Winged Rock, commonly called by the whites
"Ship Rock," and about which I had been seeking
information.</p>

<p>This rock is situated in the Navaho reservation, about
one hundred miles northwest of Tohatchi, and some
fifteen or twenty miles from Carrizo Mountain. It is
difficult of access, and my informant assured me that
even though an army of white men should reach its
base they could never scale its steep sides and reach its
top. All the Navaho tribe reverence it sincerely and
all watch and guard it jealously. He would indeed be
a brave white man who would dare the anger of these
warlike and brave natives if they forbade his approach
and would attempt to scale this sacred Winged Rock.</p>

<p>This was the legend: "Many, many years ago, when
this country was young and the sun cast only small
shadows, my people came across the narrow sea far
away near the setting sun in the north and landed on the
shores of this country. The people where they landed
were exceedingly angry at them, and whenever they
could they fell upon them and slew them. My people
did not want to go to war, but this inhospitable reception
made them angry, so they put themselves in war
array and fell upon their foes. But there were few
only of my people, and their enemies were so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
that it was not long before they were in sad straits.
Indeed, they would soon have been entirely destroyed
had not help come. In their distress they called on
Those Above, and soon a messenger from the sky came
to my people and said: 'See you yonder stone mountain?
Flee to it. It will be your salvation. Climb
up its steep, strong, rugged sides and it will carry you
toward the land of the South sea, nearer to the rising
sun, and there your home shall be.'</p>

<p>"My people were only too glad to obey the message.
They hastened towards the mountain. Some who were
weak were enabled to fly towards it like birds, and they
clung to its steep sides and clambered to its top.</p>

<p>"Then when they were all safe on its huge bulk, the
monster rock was taken by Those Above, and it arose
and floated across the rivers and plains and mountains
and lakes and canyons. Several days and nights it
floated, and my people gazed with wonder upon the
strange and wonderful countries through which they
travelled. Sometimes they thought they would like to
stay in this place or in that, but the wisdom of Those
Above said No! and the rock floated on. Oh! it was a
glorious sail. Never before or since has any people
been so blessed and favored by the People of the
Shadows Above.</p>

<p>"Finally the Winged Rock crossed the great deep
canyon of the Colorado River, and my people were
afraid of its vast depths. Then the rock gently settled
down to the earth, where it is now found, and our home
was reached. It did not seem to be a very beautiful
land, but it was given to us by Those Above, and my
people soon became content. We were shown the
springs and the watercourses, and we found the mountains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
covered with trees, and the rivers and creeks. So
that when any one speaks of our leaving our country we
are afraid and we cry: 'No, why should we leave this
land given to us, and which we love? Yonder is the
rock on which we came, and never until that rock floats
away with us shall we leave the land that we love so
well!'</p>

<p>"As soon as we were settled here, Those Above gave
us some great shamans, and one of them told us that
we must always do right, for the sun, when it rises,
would watch our every action all throughout the day,
and when he went away at night it was to tell Those
Above all our evil actions, for which we should be
punished."</p>

<p>While the Apaches and Navahoes are of the same
stock, there have always been marked differences between
them so long as they have been under the observation
of the white men. When the Spaniards entered
the country, the Navahoes were more distinctly an
agricultural people than the Apaches. They had large
patches of land under cultivation, kept their crops and
lived in houses underground. Cultivated lands necessitated
settled residences, and after the Spaniards introduced
sheep, it was not long before the Navahoes
were extensive sheep raisers. It would not be any wiser
or more profitable to enter into an inquiry as to the
methods by which these flocks were acquired than it
would be to ascertain the history of many of the landed
possessions of European nobilities. With the Navaho,
possession was the only law he cared anything for. "To
have and to hold" was his motto; and once "having,"
he held pretty securely. Hence the sheep possessions
of the neighboring pueblo Indians were held by exceedingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
precarious tenure.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="over"></a>
  <div class="figsub" style="width: 272px;">

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">An Old Hopi at Oraibi.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And here we have, I believe, one of the additional
sources of enmity between the Navaho and the Spaniard.
As their wards, the Spanish were in duty bound to
care for and protect the Pueblos. Thus Navaho and
Spaniard were ever at war, and when the Mexican
came in the Spaniard's stead the battle still continued
on the same lines and with the same ferocity.</p>

<p>It was on the 22d of January in 1849 that Lieut.
J. H. Simpson, afterwards General, started on that
interesting trip of his through the Navaho country,
which has forever connected his name with these
nomads. He was not in command of the expedition,
its head being Col. John M. Washington, who was
military and civil governor of New Mexico at the time.
The object of the expedition was to coerce the Navahoes
into a compliance with a treaty which they had made
with the United States, two years previously, and to
extend the provisions of the treaty.</p>

<p>When they reached the Chaco Canyon trouble ripened
between the soldiers and the Navahoes, and the
latter were fired upon, with the result that seven were
killed, including Narbona, their great warrior and chief.</p>

<p>This was but one of many such attacks upon the whites.
Then as now, only far more so, the Navahoes resented
the intrusion of white people in their territory; and having
gained fire-arms, they used them to deadly purpose
upon those who slighted their will.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the Navahoes were a source
of great terror to the Mexicans who first settled in and
near their territory. Even after the United States became
their guardians at the acquisition of New Mexico
in 1847, they were very hostile, murders, robberies, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
depredations of every kind being quite common. In
1855, Dr. Letherman reported that "the nation, as a
nation, is fully imbued with the idea that it is all powerful,
which, no doubt, has arisen from the fact of its
having been for years a terror and a dread to the inhabitants
of New Mexico." But that these depredations
were not perpetrated upon the whites alone is
evident from the fact that one of the richest men of the
Navahoes himself applied to Major Kendrick, then the
commanding officer of Fort Defiance, N. Mex., to protect
his cattle, as he could not otherwise prevent his
own people from stealing them.</p>

<p>The insolence from years of this kind of free life
needed forceful check, but it was not until 1862 that
the unbearable conduct of the Navahoes brought upon
themselves this long-needed chastisement.</p>

<p>According to governmental reports, the Indians of
New Mexico (among whom were the Navahoes and
Mescalero Apaches) caused losses between 1860 and
1863 to the people of that territory of "not less than
500,000 sheep, and 5,000 horses, mules, and cattle.
Over 200 lives have been also sacrificed of citizens,
soldiers, and shepherds." It was also stated in 1863
"that the military establishment of this territory [New
Mexico, which then included Arizona], since its acquisition,
has cost not less than $3,000,000 annually, independent
of land-warrant bounties." And while this was
for a conquered country, the whole expenditure was
for the chastisement of hostile Indians, every tribe of
which in turn came in for its share of the fighting.</p>

<p>It was openly advocated about this time that the
policy of extermination was the only one that could be
followed, and this must be brought about either by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
actual warfare, or by driving the hostiles into the mountains
and there starving them to death.</p>

<p>Brig.-Gen. J. H. Carleton, who was in control of
the department of New Mexico, determined upon a
thorough and complete change in our treatment of
this haughty and proud people. They had made six
treaties at different times with officers of our Government
and had violated them before they could be ratified
at Washington. He strongly counselled drastic
measures in a letter which is historically of sufficient
interest to justify a large quotation from it:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"At the Bosque Redondo there is arable land enough for all
the Indians of this family [the Navahoes and Apaches have
descended from the same stock and speak the same language],
and I would respectfully recommend that now the war be
vigorously prosecuted against the Navahoes; that the only
peace that can ever be made with them must rest on the basis
that they move on to these lands, and, like the Pueblos, become
an agricultural people, and cease to be nomads. This
should be a <i>sine qua non</i>; as soon as the snows of winter admonish
them of the sufferings to which their families will be
exposed, I have great hopes of getting most of the tribe. The
knowledge of the perfidy of these Navahoes, gained after two
centuries of experience, is such as to lead us to put no faith in
their promises. They have no government to make treaties;
they are a patriarchal people. One set of families may make
promises, but the other set will not heed them. They understand
the direct application of force as a law; if its application
be removed, that moment they become lawless. This has
been tried over and over again, and at great expense. The
purpose now is, never to relax the application of force with a
people that can no more be trusted than the wolves that run
through the mountains. To collect them together, little by
little, on to a reservation, away from the haunts and hills and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
hiding-places of their country; there be kind to them; there
teach their children how to read and write; teach them the
arts of peace, teach them the truths of Christianity. Soon they
will acquire new habits, new ideas, and new modes of life; and
the old Indians will die off, and carry with them all latent
longings for murdering and robbing. The young ones will take
their places without these longings, and thus, little by little,
they will become a happy and contented people; and Navaho
wars will be remembered only as something that belong entirely
to the past. Even until they can raise enough to be self-sustaining,
<i>you can feed them cheaper than fight them</i>....</p>

<p>"I know these ideas are practical and humane&mdash;are just to
the suffering people, as well as to the aggressive, perfidious,
butchering Navahoes. If I can have one more <i>full</i> regiment
of cavalry, and authority to raise one independent company in
each county of the Territory, they can soon be carried to a
final result."</p></blockquote>

<p>In 1863 General Carleton's suggestions in the main
were approved by the Indian Department and he proceeded
to carry out his plan.</p>

<p>Col. Kit Carson, the noted scout, with an adequate
force was sent out to humble and punish the Navahoes.
It was wise that such a just, humane, and wise Indian
fighter was sent to do this work. His knowledge of
their characters stood him in good purpose, and in a
very short time over seven thousand prisoners were
taken. Later this number was increased, until they
amounted to about ten or eleven thousand.</p>

<p>At the same time the Apaches were being cornered,
and a number of them were removed to Fort Stanton,
on the Peeos River, far enough down into the open
country to prevent easy escape to the mountains. Part
of this settlement was the Bosque Redondo, and General
Carleton's plan contemplated the settlement of both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Apaches and Navahoes here.</p>

<p>Compelled by a superior force, the now humbled
Navahoes were herded together like sheep and in 1863
were removed to the chosen place. It was soon found,
however, that this was an inhospitable region, altogether
unfitted to be the home of so large a population. The
water was alkaline, and the soil not of a nature suitable
to the raising of corn. There was practically no fuel,
and the Navahoes had to dig up mesquite roots and
carry them on their backs twelve miles for this purpose.
In two or three years more than one-fourth of their
number died and the remainder grew more and more
dissatisfied with the location.</p>

<p>In 1867, however, Manuelito and Barboncita, two of
the war chiefs, came into the reservation, both of them
having surrendered to the commandant at Fort Wingate.
The former had refused to come into the reservation
in 1863, and the latter ran away from it, with his band of
warriors, in 1864. These two bands added 780 more
of men, women, and children to the population, which,
in June, 1867, was reported to be 7,300.</p>

<p>This whole Bosque Redondo was a disgraceful business,
on a line with so much of the wretched and abominable
treatment the Indians have received at our hands.
Think of placing ten thousand Indians upon a reservation
where there was no water but black, brackish stuff not
fit for cattle, no fuel, and no soil for cultivation of the
chief article of their diet. Deprived of food, water, and
fuel, what would white men be? No wonder the Navahoes
rebelled and were kept in order only by brute force.</p>

<p>At length those in authority saw the iniquity of the
proceeding and the order was given to return them to
their reservation. This was done, but with a loss by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
death, mainly through preventable causes, of over three
thousand souls.</p>

<p>Since this time they have been industrious and progressive.
The Bosque lesson, though severe, was needed,
and it proved salutary. One can travel with perfect
safety unarmed across the Navaho reservation, as I have
done several times; and a lady friend, unarmed, and
unaccompanied by any other escort than a Navaho, has
travelled hundreds of miles in perfect safety among the
Navahoes in all parts of their reservation.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>In September, 1870, a number of dissatisfied Utes
visited the Navahoes at the so-called "Navaho Church,"
which can be seen on the right on the line of the Santa
F&eacute; Railway, going to California. All the principal
chiefs of the tribe were present and the causes of
dissatisfaction against the whites were fully discussed.
The powwow was an important one, and lasted several
days, but the chief purpose of the Utes&mdash;to incite the
Navahoes to warfare against the whites&mdash;was not successful.
The crafty Utes, with stirring eloquence, said
they had heard the white men saying they were going to
take possession of the whole country, and that when
they did they would kill off all the chief men of the
Navahoes. "See how they have stolen in upon your
territory and taken the springs and land that you have
had all the time up till now! They have taken the
water and land at Wingate and at Defiance, and soon
they will take all you have, and you and your children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
will perish because you have no water, no grass for your
horses and sheep, and no corn for food. Join in with
us and drive these hated people away. Get all the guns
and ammunition you can, and prepare many new bows
and arrows. Let us sing the war songs together, and go
on the war-path and hunt down and kill the whites
as the Pueblos hunt down and kill rabbits. Then we
will be friends. You will have your country to yourselves,
and Those Above will make of you a great nation.
We shall have our country and we shall become great.
Now we are dwindling down; we are melting away as
the snows on the hillside. United against the whites
we shall both become stronger, and grow like the well-watered
corn."</p>

<p>The Navahoes refused to give answer until they had
consulted among themselves, and then one of their chiefs
reported their decision as follows: "We have heard
what our Ute brothers have said. If our white brothers
want to kill us they can do so. They have had plenty
of chances and we are yet alive. All of our people who
have been slain have been those who have gone on the
war-path against them in the past. We do not wish to
die, so we will not go on the war-path. We will stay
at home. We have food. The whites treat us well. If
our Ute brothers must fight we will not interfere, but
we ourselves do not wish to fight."</p>

<p>The result was that the Ute bands returned to their
homes without any specific act of warfare at that time.</p>

<h2><a name="ChIX." id="ChIX."></a>CHAPTER IX<br />
<small>THE NAVAHO AT HOME</small></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> Navaho reservation, embracing nearly four
million acres, or eleven thousand square miles, was
established by treaty with the Navahoes of June 1, 1868,
and has been modified or enlarged by subsequent executive
orders of October 29, 1878, January 6, 1880, May
17, 1884, April 24, 1886, November 19, 1892, and January
6, 1900. The major portion is in Arizona, but about
six hundred and fifty square miles are in New Mexico.
Its average elevation is about six thousand feet, though
near the Colorado River it is often but four thousand.
The highest peak is about in the centre of the present
reservation, in the Tunicha Mountains, and is upwards
of nine thousand five hundred feet high.</p>

<p>The Tunicha range is covered with glorious and majestic
pines, and all along its flanks are wide plateaus
through which gloomy and massive canyons convey the
storm waters from the heights above into the plains
below. Its close proximity to the Grand Canyon suggests
what its general appearance might be. Drained
deep down by the canyons and gorges tributary to this
great vampire canyon, it is seamed and scarred by the
dashing down of many waters. Its rocks are cut up
into a thousand fantastic forms and shapes, which look
over sterile valleys full of sand. These valleys are
numberless, and one of them, the I-chi-ni-li,&mdash;commonly
called the Chin-lee,&mdash;stretches from the south to beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the San Juan River on the north, to the west of
the Tunicha range.</p>

<p>The ancient boundaries of the land, long prior to the
advent of the Spaniard, were four majestic mountains,
which now approximately determine the reserve. On
the east is Pelado Peak; on the south, Mt. San Mateo
(commonly called Mt. Taylor); on the west, the San
Francisco range; and on the north, the San Juan Mountains.
Each of these is over eleven thousand feet in
height. Hence it will be seen that there is a vast range
of altitude, yet it is questionable whether anywhere else
in the world so large a population inhabits so barren
and inhospitable a country. On the lower levels it is
mainly desert, with scant pasture here and there; on
the higher mesas or plateaus there are many junipers,
pinions, and red cedars.</p>

<p>It is a difficult matter to determine the population
of the Navahoes. While they were in captivity the
official count was seven thousand three hundred, but
desertions were frequent, and at one time about seven
hundred of the renegades came in and surrendered, and
it is well known that many never were captured or
surrendered.</p>

<p>In 1869 the government distributed thirty thousand
sheep and two thousand goats to them, and a count
was ordered. This was a most favorable time to make
it, as besides the sheep and goats, two years' annuities
were given out, and rations distributed every four days.
The total summed up some nine thousand.</p>

<p>In 1890 the official census reported 17,204, but
Cosmos Mendeleff, writing in 1895-96, says the tribe
numbers only "over 12,000 souls." It scarcely seems
possible, if the count in 1869 was anything near accurate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
that the population could have increased to 17,204 in
1890. Still it must be remembered that, though not
prolific, the Navaho is a good breeder. He is healthy,
vigorous, robust, and strong, and his wife (or wives, for
he is a polygamist) equally so. Living an out-door life,
inured to hardships, generally possessed of plenty to
eat, of coarse, rough, hearty, but nutritious food, engaged
in occupations and indulging in sports that cultivate their
athletic powers, free from the consumptive and scrofulous
tendencies of most reservation Indians, they are well
fitted to be the progenitors of healthy children.</p>

<p>Though polygamists, they are moral and chaste. In
their legends they have always regarded marital
unfaithfulness as a prolific source of sorrow and punishment.
In their Origin Legend this sin led to their banishment
from the first world, and again from the second, and
also from the third, the wronged chief execrating them
as follows: "For such crimes I suppose you were
chased from the world below; you shall drink no more
of our water, you shall breathe no more of our air.
Begone!"</p>

<p>In this legend Washington Matthews tells of G&oacute;ntso,
or Big Knee, a chief who had twelve wives, four from
each of three different gens or families. Though he was
a bountiful provider, his wives were unfaithful to him.
He complained to the chiefs of their families and to their
relations and begged them to remonstrate with the
wicked women, but remonstrances and rebukes seemed
to be in vain. At last they said to Big Knee, "Do
with them as you will, we shall not interfere." The
next time he detected the unfaithfulness of his wives
he mutilated one, another he cut the ears from, a third
cut off her breasts, and all these three died. A fourth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
he cut off her nose, and she lived. He thereupon determined
that henceforth he would cut off the nose of any
unfaithful wife, for that would be a visible mark of her
shame and yet would not kill her. She would be compelled
to live, and all men and women would know of
her wickedness. But even this horrible punishment did
not have the deterrent effect he expected. It was not
long before another and then another was detected and
punished, until, before long, his whole family of wives
was noseless. Instead of rebuking themselves and their
sins as the cause of their mutilation these women would
gather together to rail against their husband, and their
relations, whom they claimed should have protected
them. Big Knee was compelled to sleep alone in
a well-protected hut, and the women grew more determined
than ever to work him an injury.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="kapata"></a>
  <div class="figsub" style="width: 272px;">
    <img class="border" src="images/image30l.jpg" width="272" height="342" alt="Kapata, Antelope Priest, at Walpi. A Mashonganavi Hopi, going to hoe his Corn." />

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Mashonganavi Hopi, going to hoe his Corn.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>About this time the people got up a big ceremony
for the benefit of Big Knee. It lasted nine days, and
on the night of the last day the mutilated women, who
had kept themselves secluded in a hut, came forth, and
with knives in their hands, proceeded to sing and dance
as was expected of them. Around the fire they circled,
singing "Peshla ashila"&mdash;"It was the knife that did
it to me"&mdash;and peering among the spectators for their
husband. He was safe, however, for he was hidden in
the circle of branches that made the dance corral. As
they concluded the dance they ran from the corral,
cursing all who were present with fearful maledictions:
"May the waters drown ye! May the winters freeze ye!
May the fires burn ye! May the lightnings strike ye!"
and other equally malicious curses. Then they departed
and went into the far north, where they now dwell, and,
according to the Navahoes, whenever these noseless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
women turn their faces to the south we have cold winds
and storms and lightning.</p>

<p>From this legend it is observed that the husband's power
over the wife was somewhat limited. G&oacute;ntso dare not
punish his wives without the consent of their relations.
This freedom of the woman is observed to this day, she
regarding herself in most things as the equal, and sometimes
the superior, of her husband.</p>

<p>From all I can learn, marital unchastity is uncommon,
though where the tribe is in close contact with the towns
along the railway there are generally to be found men
who will sell their wives and daughters, and mothers who
will sell their girls to debased white men. Among the
respectable members of the tribe, if a man discovers that
his wife, or one of them, is unfaithful, he may take it
upon himself to chastise her, but such is the independent
position of the woman that he must be very wise
and judicious or she will speedily leave him.</p>

<p>Divorce is not common, but is allowable for cause,
the parties chiefly concerned generally settling all the
details. Occasionally, however, a transaction occurs
that in civilized society would occasion quite a buzz of
busy tongues. One such happened but a few years
ago. Mr. George H. Pepper of the American Museum
of Natural History tells the story. The facts were
within his own knowledge. One of the husbands had
a wife who positively refused to wash and brush his hair.
He would coax and persuade, urge and command,
threaten and bluster, but all to no effect. The dusky
creature was neither to be led nor driven. If he wanted
his hair washed and combed he must do it himself.</p>

<p>While the disappointed husband was cogitating over his
miserable marital experiences, a friend from a distance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
with his wife, came to visit him. As the men got to
talking and finally exchanging confidences about their
wives, the one told the other of the unwifely conduct of
his spouse. The visitor condoled with his host and told
what a good wife he had, how very obedient she was,
and the like, until he had quite exalted her, and the host
determined to take a better look than he had hitherto
given at such a paragon of a wife. Whether this was
a scheme of the visitor or not it was scarcely possible to
tell, but, anyhow, it worked out as well as if it had been
carefully planned; for as the host studied the visitor's
wife he fell head over ears in love with her, and, strange
to say, a corresponding affinity was discovered to exist
between the two others. Accordingly, a day or two
later the visitor suggested to the host that as he (the
host) wanted a wife to wash and comb his hair, while he
(the visitor) was content with a wife that would do
neither, what was to hinder their "swapping" their life
partners and thus making a satisfactory end to his domestic
difficulties? With joy the disappointed husband
accepted the offer,&mdash;a little "boot" was required to
make the exchange satisfactorily, and then the result was
communicated to the women. Neither of them was
consulted in the slightest, but without any hesitancy
they fell in with the agreement. The visitor rode off
satisfied, accompanied by his new wife, while the wife
who came as a visitor inaugurated her new relationship
by shyly coming into her new husband's hogan with an
olla of water, the necessary soap-root, and the whisk
with which to wash and comb her liege's hair. And
now, for three years, the two couples are known to have
lived together in "amity and concord."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>A few years ago it would perhaps have been safe to
designate the Navahoes as the most wealthy Indians of
the United States. Many of them were worth hundreds
of dollars. They understood and practised the art
of irrigation; they grew large crops of corn, squash,
melons, beans, chili, and onions. Some had large and
thriving bands of horses, which they traded with the
Havasupais, Wallapais, Hopis, Paiutis, and other neighboring
people. I have often met a band of six or eight
Navaho traders with horses and blankets in the canyon
of the Havasu, and they took away the well-dressed
buckskins in exchange, for which these canyon people
are noted. From the Paiutis, they obtained baskets
and their <i>tusjehs</i>, or wicker-work, pinion gum-covered
water-bottles.</p>

<p>As for sheep and goats, there are few places in the
United States where so many were to be found as on
the Navaho reservation. Every family had its flock,
as every woman was a blanket weaver; and one of the
prettiest sights in the whole Painted Desert Region was
to come upon a flock of these gentle, domestic creatures
quietly pasturing, led or driven by the owner herself,
or one of her children.</p>

<p>But the last few years have made a great difference
in their prosperity. Rains have been rare, water scarce,
and pasture scant, and as a result their flocks are
reduced to woeful proportions. Their nomadic habits
render the improvement of their locations impossible,
and their superstition in regard to the burning of a
hogan in which any one has died compels frequent
migrations.</p>

<p>There is no doubt but that for the past three hundred
years of historic time the Navahoes have been thieves,
robbers, and murderers. The Hopis contend that all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
sheep they had before the general distribution, earlier
referred to, were stolen from them. This is probably
true, but it is equally probable that had the Navahoes
not stolen them the Utes would; and while this seems
poor comfort, after facts showed that it was an exceedingly
good thing that Navahoes rather than Utes became
their possessors. For, once in their possession, the
Navahoes became careful breeders (for aborigines) of
sheep, and when marauding bands of Utes came into
the country the warlike Navahoes drove them away,
thus defending the sheep so that the Hopis could obtain
the nucleus of a new flock later on.</p>

<p>In the next chapter I present, a fairly full and accurate
account of the art of blanket-weaving, for which the
Navahoes are now so noted.</p>

<p>As a rule the physical development of the Navahoes is
sturdy and robust, as will be seen from the accompanying
photographs. They average well, and with slight
range on either side from a fair and normal development.
There are few excessively strong, and equally few
very weak people among them. The same may be said
of their fatness and leanness, both extremes being rare.</p>

<p>The men, as is common with all Indians, pluck out
the hair on both lips and chin, though, occasionally,
one will find a man who has allowed his moustache to
grow. The hair on the head is seldom cut, and with
both sexes is allowed to grow long. The men tie it
in a knot behind, and wrap a high-colored "banda"
around the forehead, thus confining the hair and adding
considerably to their own picturesqueness.</p>

<p>Being a prosperous people, they are generally contented
looking, and wear that air of complacent self-satisfaction
that is a sure sign of prosperity. It seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
clearly to say: "We are a good people, a specially
favored because specially deserving people, hence look
upon us and understand our prosperity." There are
no beggars among the better class of the Navahoes,
and men as well as women are hard workers. As a
nation they are decidedly producers. Mr. Cotton has
large gangs of them working at grading, etc., on the Santa
F&eacute; Railway, and they can be found helping white men
in as many and as various occupations as the Chinese
in California. The industry of the women is proverbial,
for seldom will one be found idle, her greatest seeming
pleasure being to have her hands constantly occupied.
What with carding the wool, washing, dyeing, and spinning
it, preparing the dyes (after collecting them) for
coloring it, and then weaving the blankets for which
they are famous, going out into the mountains to collect
the wild seeds and roots of which they are fond,
caring for the corn, tending the sheep and goats, preparing
the daily food, and many other duties that they
impose upon themselves, none can say they are not
models of industry. Men, women, and children alike
are fearless riders. The wealth of many a man is
determined by his possessions of horses and sheep, and
from earliest years the boys are required to attend to
the bands of horses. In their semi-nomad life the
women ride about with the men, and thus become
skilled riders. They sit astride, mounting and
dismounting as easily as the men, and riding wherever
occasion demands.</p>

<p>The saddles are made by the men, and are a modification
of the big-horned Mexican variety. The tree is
cut out with infinite patience and care, and is then
covered with rawhide or bought leather, and adorned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
with rows of brass-headed nails. The girth, or cinch, is
home woven, of wool, cotton, or horsehair, the former
being preferred.</p>

<p>That the Navahoes are or were expert engineers, and
could construct difficult trails, is evidenced by their
trails into Chaca Canyon from the mesa above. Simpson
thus describes what he saw in 1849: "A mile
further, observing several Navahoes high above us,
on the brink of the north wall, shouting and gesticulating
as if they were very glad to see us, what was our
astonishment when they commenced tripping down
the almost sheer wall before them, as nimbly and
dexterously as minuet dancers! Indeed, the force
of gravity, and their descent upon a steep inclined
plane, made such a kind of performance absolutely
necessary to insure their equilibrium."</p>

<p>They are a remarkably intelligent people, and their
faces are, as a rule, pliant and expressive. There is
none of the proverbial stolidness to be found among
any except very few of the older men of the Navahoes.
If you are unwelcome you will know it,&mdash;surly looks
and words will ask your mission and bid you begone.
On the other hand, if you are welcome, glad smiles will
light up the faces of your friends, and you will hear
sweet words uttered by melodious and tuneful voices.
It is seldom that your courteous advances will be
repelled, though they are very ready to resent unwelcome
intrusions. I have often sat for hours in the
hogans of entire strangers, and the conversation of
men and women was general and punctuated with
laughter and smiles, showing that they know how to
make and appreciate jokes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>The Navahoes play a game common in the Southwest,
which they call nanzosh. It is a simple game,
yet they seem to get endless fun and amusement from
it, often gambling large sums upon their favorite
players, for, while it looks and is simple, it is not easy
to play so as to win. It requires great skill and accurate
throwing. The implements are two long poles and
a small hoop. The poles are generally of alder and in
two pieces, a fathom long, and a long, many-tailed string
called the turkey-claw is fastened to the end of each.
Two players only are needed. One throws the hoop.
Both follow, and when they think the hoop is about to
fall, they throw their respective poles so that the hoop,
in its fall, will rest upon those portions of their poles
that give the highest counts.</p>

<p>Catlin describes a similar game played by the Mandans,
though their pole is a single piece of wood, as is
that of the Mohaves and Yumas, both of whom have the
same game.</p>

<p>The taboo is in existence in all its force among the
Navahoes. The most singular of these is that which forbids
a man ever to look upon the face of his mother-in-law.
Among civilized people it is a standard subject
for rude jesting, this relationship of the mother-in-law,
but with the Navahoes, the white man's jest is a subject
of great earnestness. Each believes that serious
consequences will follow if they see each other; hence, as
it is the custom for a man to live with his wife's people,
constant dodging is required, and the cries of warning,
given by one or another of the family to son or mother-in-law,
are often heard. I was once photographing the
family of Manuelito, the last great war-chief of the
Navahoes. The widow of the chief, her two daughters,
their husbands and children, made up the group.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
But there was no getting of them together. I would
photograph the mother with her daughters and grandchildren,
but as soon as I called for the daughters'
husbands, the mother "slid" out of sight, and when I
wished for her return, the men disappeared.</p>

<p>Then, too, a Navaho will never touch fish, much less
eat it. According to one of the shamans, the reason for
this is, that some of their ancestors were once turned
into fish in the San Juan River, and, were they to eat
fish, they might thus become cannibals, and eat descendants
of their own ancestors. As neither Matthews nor
Stephen refers to this cause of the taboo, I merely give
it for what it may be worth. The former tells of a white
woman, who, in a spirit of mischief, threw a pan of water
in which fish had been soaked over a young Navaho.
He changed his clothes and bathed himself carefully, in
order that no taint of the tabooed fish might remain
upon him. I have had a great deal of fun by innocently
offering candy in the form of fish to Navahoes. As
they are fond of candy, it was a strong proof of the
power of the taboo that they invariably refused to
touch it.</p>

<p>Superstition naturally forms a large part of the Navaho's
thought. He believes in charms, amulets, fetishes,
witchcraft, taboos, magic, and all the wondrous things
he can conceive. His name for a personal fetish is <i>Bizha</i>,
"his treasure, something he especially values; hence
his charm, his amulet, his personal fetish, his magic
weapon, something that one carries to mysteriously
protect himself."</p>

<p>The talisman or amulet for the gambler is a piece of
fine turquoise, because Noholipi, a gambling god, who
appears in their Origin Legend, was made successful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
always with a large piece of this precious stone.</p>

<p>There are quite a number of medicine-men, or
shamans, among the Navahoes, some good, others bad.
It has been my privilege to know several who are men
of dignity and character.</p>

<p>Dr. Matthews, in writing of them, thus strongly expresses
himself: "There are, among the Navahoes, charlatans
and cheats who treat disease; men who pretend
to suck disease out of the patient, and then draw from
their own mouths pebbles, pieces of charcoal, or bodies
of insects, claiming that these are the disease which
they have extracted. But the priests of the great rites
are not to be classed with such. All of these with
whom the writer is acquainted are above such trickery.
They perform their ceremonies in the firm conviction
that they are invoking divine aid, and their calling
lends dignity to their character." Of Hatali Natloi,
the smiling chanter, he says: "He would be considered
a man of high character in any community. He is
dignified, courteous, kind, honest, truthful, and self-respecting."</p>

<p>This is the universal testimony of all who know this
class of men with reasonable intimacy. Though the
white man may believe the performances of a shaman
ridiculous or superstitious, that need not interfere with
his respect and esteem.</p>

<p>To understand this subject aright, one must clearly
apprehend the Indian meaning of the terms "medicine,"
and "medicine-men." Oftentimes the latter are
called priests, sometimes thaumaturgists, oftener shamans,
and, of course, by all unknowing white men are
unhesitatingly denounced as frauds and humbugs. Now
to the Indian all things that work injury to him are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
bad medicine. If you write his name (or any scrawl
he cannot understand) on a piece of paper and look at
it solemnly and then at him, at the same time shaking
your head, you can persuade him into the belief that it
is "bad medicine." Owen Wister recently wrote in one
of the popular magazines an interesting story, the
whole plot of which was based upon his knowledge of
this fact.</p>

<p>With the Navaho it is "bad medicine" to touch an
achindee hogan (or house). When a person dies within
a house, the rafters are tumbled over the body, and the
whole set on fire. After that it would be exceeding
"bad medicine" for a Navaho to go near the spot, or
touch a piece of wood belonging to that hogan; for the
spirit (the achindee) is supposed to remain in the
locality, and he resents any undue intrusion into his
domain. Before I was aware of the custom and feeling,
I camped near an abandoned and partially burned
hogan. When I sent my Navaho man to it for wood
for a fire, he went half a mile away into the mountain
and stayed there. I was unable to understand his feeling,
but later I learned that except under the pangs of
direst hunger, he would never have touched a morsel
of food prepared over a fire in which wood from the
achindee hogan had been used.</p>

<p>Medicine-men are often used as instruments for the
working of private revenge. Cowards are to be found
among Indians as among white men. Among white
men these despicable wretches attack their foes through
the columns of newspapers or in the pages of magazines,
while among the former they call in the services of a
medicine-man. This hired charlatan then either directly
or by proxy works upon the fears of the man he is hired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
to injure. Sometimes he actually poisons or otherwise
harms him under pretence of protecting him. But the
Indian is dreadfully superstitious, and to work upon his
mind is easy, and he soon imagines himself to be sick.</p>

<p>For the cure of disease the better class of Navaho
shamans have a system of chanting, praying, dancing,
bathing, sweating, etc., that Dr. Matthews has fully described
in the United States Bureau of Ethnology
reports. The complexity of these ceremonies cannot
be comprehended or conceived by those whose knowledge
of the Indian is superficial and casual.</p>

<p>If, however, a shaman makes himself unpopular, or
fails to cure in several successive cases, or earns the
enmity of a treacherous shaman foe, he is liable to be
accused of witchcraft, and if a sufficient number of the
people can be made to believe the charge he is speedily
done away with. One of the shamans made famous by
Dr. Matthews was recently killed on account of his
harsh and tyrannical manner. He was accused of
witchcraft and shot. Hence it will be seen that the
Navaho is not yet perfect&mdash;any more than his white
brother. No, indeed!</p>

<p>There are other points in which he is similar to his
brother of the white skin. Some years ago I journeyed
in a wagon with an old Arizona pioneer, Franklin French,
from Winslow, on the line of the Santa F&eacute;, through the
Hopi country, the Mormon town of Tuba City, past the
Navaho settlements of Willow Springs, Echo Reef, etc.,
to Lee's Ferry of the Colorado River.</p>

<p>Beyond Willow Springs we camped one night, and I
went to a Navaho hogan to purchase corn and vegetables
for ourselves, and feed for the horses. Everything was
six prices too high, but the Navahoes knew I was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
need of their articles and raised the prices accordingly.
It is not only the white man that understands the principle
of "cornering the market." We compromised,
however, and, after a hearty supper and a chat around
the camp-fire, I rolled myself up in my blankets ready
to sleep until called for breakfast in the morning.</p>

<p>But what a babel of confusing and distressing sounds
it was that awakened me! Surely we must be beset by
a band of marauding Navahoes, bent on murdering us!
No; it was only a wordy fight between my driver and
three Navaho women, who had come to demand compensation
for depredations committed in their corn-field
by our horses. Hobbled, and turned loose, they had
discovered somehow, during the night, that on Echo
Reef were corn and other good fodder to be had in the
place of the scant feed offered below; so, following their
noses, they had wandered into corn-fields and melon-patches
to their own delectation, but the manifest injury
of the crops. What was to be done about it? French
was advising that the Navahoes imitate the example of
the Hopis and cut off a portion of the ear of each offending
animal, but the women angrily laughed him to scorn
and vociferously demanded <i>cinquo pesos</i> for the damage.
These were not forthcoming, but I urged the squaws on,
telling them to insist that the hoary-headed old miser
pay them their just demands, and informing them, in
purest English, of the opinions French had expressed
regarding them, as a people, the night before. The
aborigines didn't quite know what to make out of my
fluent verbosity, and French at last impatiently turned
to me and told me there'd be a "pretty general monkey
and parrot time started here pretty quick, if I didn't let
up, and that'll be follered by a pretty tall foot-race<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
between us two, in which you'll be 'way off in the lead."
So we compromised with our dusky visitors by inviting
them to eat up the remnants of our breakfast, and
then carry away a little coffee and sugar. The only
thing I am now afraid of is that, at the next visit I make
them, they will privately and stealthily, under the cover
of night, lead our steeds into the forbidden fields, and
encourage them in their thefts, in order that they may
enjoy another "compromise."</p>

<p>Primitive peoples at an early date felt the desire for
personal adornment. With the Navaho this found
expression in painting the body with various colored
ochres or clays, in fashioning garments out of
the skins of animals, in wearing head-dresses and
other fantastic ornaments made from feathers, and in
necklaces, bracelets, anklets, and wristlets made of
small flint arrowpoints, or of the dried seeds of
juniper, pinion, and other plants, or of bones. Later
they secured beads of shell, turquoise, and coral by
barter.</p>

<p>But nearly all this primitive decoration received a
rude shock of displacement when the Mexican colonist
came upon the scene, with his iron, copper, and silver
adornments glittering in the sunlight. From coveting,
the Navaho took to possessing by fair means or foul.
He would barter his skins or other native possessions
for the precious metals, using brass and copper for the
making of ornaments, and iron for tipping his arrows.
Silver, however, has never lost its charm for him. The
Mexican vaquero, trapped out in the glittering metal,
has ever been his ideal of personal adornment, and he
retains it to this day. Silver is the only coin they care
to accept, though the better educated now know the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
superior value of gold.</p>

<p>There are some clever, skilful silversmiths among
them&mdash;peshlikais, as they call themselves. In crucibles
of their own manufacture they melt the precious
metal, using a crude and primitive blast furnace, with
charcoal as fuel, and the molten silver is then poured
into moulds which they have shaped out of sandstone
or other rock. They understand the art of uniting two
pieces of metal together, for many of their ornaments
are hollow and globular, originally made in two parts
and then joined. Scarcely a man or woman of any
standing in the tribe does not possess a home-manufactured
necklace of silver beads or articles of some design,&mdash;a
finger ring or two, one or more bracelets, and
sometimes a pair of ear pendants. Above all they covet
the belt with large silver disks. Each of these disks
is made of two or more silver dollars, melted and run
into a flat mould. This thick sheet is then hammered
out to the required size and shape, which is either oval
or circular, and chased with small tools. The border
is generally filleted and the edges scalloped. When
finished each disk has a value of twice its original cost
in coin silver. Sometimes a belt will contain eight or
nine disks and a buckle, which cannot be bought for less
than thirty-six to forty dollars. This, too, is actual cost
price. If the Navaho doesn't care to part with it, an
extra five or ten dollars, or even more, is required to
induce him to let it go.</p>

<p>In addition to these objects of personal adornment,
many of the more wealthy have silver bridles. The
bridle itself is made of leather or woven horsehair, and
then the silver strips and bars, artistically chased and
decorated, are placed and fastened on the headstall.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Silver buttons of pretty and tasty design are commonly
used on gaiters and moccasins. These are made
from beaten coins, twenty-five and fifty-cent pieces, and
the obverse side is often found in its original state as
stamped in the United States or Mexican mint.</p>

<p>The bracelets are of various designs, sometimes
simple round circlets; other times the silver is triangular,
but the most common shape is a flat band, on the
outer side of which chasings and gravings are made.
These bracelets are made so that they can be slipped
sideways over the wrist. These and all the other articles
mentioned are worn equally by women and men.</p>

<p>The finger rings are often adorned with a rude setting
of turquoise or garnet. The former is found in various
parts of New Mexico, and on their reservation they dig
garnets, spinel rubies, jacinths, peridots, opals, smoky
topaz, and crystal spar in large quantities. From the
Petrified Forest they obtain jasper, carnelian, chalcedony,
agate, and amethyst. All these objects are rudely
polished and shaped, and used on rings, ear pendants,
or necklaces.</p>

<p>It has been stated that the Navaho is exceedingly
superstitious about making or allowing to be made any
representation of a snake, and that on one occasion a
silversmith who offended by beginning to make a bracelet
of rattlesnake design was cruelly beaten, his
workshop demolished, and the hated emblem destroyed.
This may be true, but I have ridden all over the Navaho
reservation wearing both a rattlesnake ring and bracelet,
and have had several made for me, on different parts
of the reservation, by different peshlikais. I am now
wearing a ring of rattlesnake design made by a Navah
silversmith and given to me with this thought as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
explained to me by the donor: "The snake watches and
guards for us our springs and water-courses. Water
is the most precious thing we possess in the desert. I
make for you this ring in the form of a snake, that the
power that guards our most precious thing may always
guard you."</p>

<p>I wore this ring when unfortunately I was bitten by
a rattlesnake at Ph&#339;nix, in February, 1902; but as I
speedily recovered, I am satisfied that my Navaho friend
will insist that it was the ring and its virtues that kept
me from sudden death, and that hastened my complete
recovery.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>A most interesting settlement of Navahoes is that of
To-hatch-i, or Little Water, some forty miles northwest
of Gallup, New Mexico. Here I was invited by Mrs.
E. H. De Vore, the teacher of the government school.
The drive is over an interesting country, part of
which is covered by junipers and cedars, and where the
road winds around strangely and fantastically sculptured
rocks as it reaches the great Navaho plateau.</p>

<p>The major portion of the Navahoes were kind and
hospitable and greeted me cordially. The day after my
arrival I was talking with Hosteen Da-&auml;-zhy about the
other Indian tribes I had visited, when suddenly the
thought came to me which I immediately expressed:
"When I go to my friends the Hopis and Acomas and
Zunis they always know I am weary and tired with my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
long journey across the sandy desert, and they have
their women prepare a bowl of "tal-a-wush" and cool
and refresh me by shampooing my head." Talawush
is the Navaho for the root of the amole (soap-root),
which, macerated and then beaten up and down in a bowl
of water, produces a delicious lather, which, for a shampoo,
has no equal.</p>

<p>In a moment, as though grieved by his thoughtlessness
and want of hospitality, Da-&auml;-zhy called to his
oldest daughter, and bade her prepare some talawush
to give me a shampoo. The woman muttered some
protest,&mdash;"it was enough to wash her own husband's
head without having to wash mine,"&mdash;but her father
sternly rebuked her for her want of courtesy to the
stranger. In a short time the preparations were all
made. I sent to Mrs. De Vore and borrowed a couple
of towels, and then in the shade outside knelt down with
my head over a large bowl full of the refreshing suds.
Very gently at first, and afterwards more vigorously,
the good woman lathered my head&mdash;and oh, how cooling
and soothing it was!&mdash;while her sister and the interpreter
stood by and laughed. Then Hosteen himself
came and laughed at the droll remarks of his daughter.
This general laughter called others, and by and by
Mrs. De Vore and her sister could not resist the temptation
to come and see what all the fun was about. Just
as they sat down, close by, my gentle manipulator was
saying: "Navaho men have hair only on the top of their
heads, but you have hair also on the bottom [my beard].
Shall I also put talawush on the bottom hair as well as
the top?" Laughingly I bade her put it everywhere
she liked, and just as my mouth was at its widest she
brought up a handful of suds and filled it full. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
course I half choked, and this only made the laugh
greater than ever, for, with the greatest coolness and
sly nonchalance she exclaimed: "It is a good thing
that you got a mouthful. White men need to have
their mouths washed out pretty often!"</p>

<p>And what a delightful sensation the whole operation
gave one! It was refreshing beyond description, and,
for days after, my hair was as silky and soft as that of
a child.</p>

<h2><a name="ChX." id="ChX."></a>CHAPTER X<br />
<small>THE NAVAHO AS A BLANKET WEAVER</small><a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="smcap">hen</span> the Spaniard came into Arizona and New
Mexico three hundred and fifty years ago, he
found the art of weaving in a well-advanced stage
among the domestic and sedentary Pueblo Indians, and
the wild and nomad Navahoes. The cotton of these
blankets was grown by these Arizona Indians from
time immemorial, and they also used the tough fibres
of the yucca, and agave leaves, and the hairs of various
wild animals, either separately or with cotton. Their
processes of weaving were exactly the same then as
they are to-day, there being but slight differences
between the methods followed before the advent of the
whites and after. Hence, in a study of Indian blanketry,
as it is made even to-day, we are approximating nearly
to the pure aboriginal methods of pre-Columbian times.</p>

<p>Arch&aelig;ologists and ethnologists generally presume
that the art of weaving on the loom was learned by the
Navahoes from their Pueblo neighbors. All the facts
in the case seem to bear out this supposition. Yet, as
is well known, the Navahoes are a part of the great
Athabascan family, which has scattered, by separate
migrations, from Alaska into California, Arizona, and
New Mexico. Many of the Alaskans are good weavers,
and according to Navaho traditions, their ancestors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
when they came into the country, wore blankets that
were made of cedar bark and of yucca fibre. Even in
the Alaska (Thlinket) blankets, made to-day of the
wool of the white mountain-goat, cedar bark is twisted
in with the wool of the warp. Why, then, should not
the Navaho woman have brought the art of weaving,
possibly in a very primitive condition, from her original
Alaskan home? That her art, however, has been improved
by contact with the pueblo Hopi, and other
Indians, there can be no question, and, if she had a
crude loom, it was speedily replaced by the one so long
used by the Pueblo. Where the Pueblo weaver gained
her loom we do not know, whether from the tribes of
the South, or by her own invention. But in all practical
ways the primitive loom was as complete and perfect
at the Spanish conquest as it is to-day.</p>

<p>Any loom, to be complete, must possess certain
qualifications. As Professor Mason has well said: "In
any style of mechanical weaving, however simple or
complex, even in darning, the following operations are
performed: First, raising and lowering alternately
different sets of warp filaments to form the 'sheds';
second, throwing the shuttle, or performing some operation
that amounts to the same thing; third, after inserting
the weft thread, driving it home, and adjusting it by
means of the batten,&mdash;be it the needle, the finger, the
shuttle, or a separate device."</p>

<p>The frame is made of four cottonwood or cedar poles
cut from the trees that line the nearest stream or grow
in the mountain forests. Two of these are forked for
uprights, and the cross beams are lashed to them above
and below. Sometimes the lower beam is dispensed
with, and wooden pegs driven into the earth are used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
instead. The frame ready, the warp is arranged on
beams, which are lashed to the top and bottom of the
frame by means of a rawhide or horsehair riata (our
Western word "lariat" is merely a corruption of <i>la riata</i>).
Thus the warp is made tight and is ready for the nimble
fingers of the weaver. Her shuttles are pieces of
smooth, round stick upon the ends of which she has
wound her yarn, or even the small balls of yarn are
made to serve this purpose. By her side is a rude
wooden comb with which she strikes a few stitches into
place, but when she wishes to wedge the yarn of a
complete row&mdash;from side to side&mdash;of weaving, she
uses for the purpose a flat, broad stick, one edge of
which is sharpened almost to knife-like keenness. This
is the "batten." With the design in her brain her busy
and skilful fingers produce the pattern as she desires it,
there being no sketch from which she may copy. In
weaving a blanket of intricate pattern and many colors
the weaver finds it easier to open the few warp threads
needed with her fingers and then thrust between them
the small balls of yarn, rather than bother with a shuttle,
no matter how simple.</p>

<p>But before blankets can be made the wool must be
cut from the backs of the sheep, cleaned, carded, spun,
and dyed. It is one of the interesting sights of the
Southwest region to see a flock of sheep and goats
running together, watched over, perhaps, by a lad of
ten or a dozen years, or by a woman who is ultimately
to weave the fleeces they carry into substantial blankets.
After the fleece has been removed from the sheep the
Navaho woman proceeds to wash it. Then it is combed
with hand cards&mdash;small flat implements in which wire
teeth are placed&mdash;purchased from the traders. (These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
and the shears are the only modern implements used.)
The dyeing is sometimes done before spinning, generally,
however, after. The spindle used is of the simplest
character&mdash;merely a slender stick thrust through a
circular disk of wood. In spite of the fact that the
Navahoes have seen the spinning-wheel in use by the
Mexicans and the Mormons, who, at Tuba City, live
practically as their neighbors, they have never cared
either to make or steal them. Their conservatism preserves
the ancient, slow and laborious method. Holding
the spindle in the right hand, the point of the short
end below the balancing disk resting on the ground,
and the long end on her knee, the spinner attaches the
end of her staple close to the disk, and then gives the
spindle a rapid twirl. As it revolves she holds the yarn
out so that it twists. As it tightens sufficiently she
allows it to wrap on to the spindle, and repeats the
operation until the spindle is full. The spinning is done
loosely or tightly according to the fineness of weave
required in the blanket. There are practically four
grades of blankets made from native wool, and it must
be prepared suitably for each grade. The coarsest is,
of course, the easiest spun. This is to make the common
blankets. These seldom have any other color
than the native gray, white, brown, and black, though
occasionally streaks of red or some other color will be
introduced. The yarn for these is coarse and fuzzy,
and nearly a quarter of an inch in diameter. The next
grade is the extra common. The yarn for this must
be a little finer, say twenty-five per cent. finer, and is
generally in a variety of colors. The third grade is the
half fancy, and this is closer woven yarn, and the colors
are a prominent feature of the completed blankets.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
These half-fancy blankets are those generally offered for
sale as the "genuine" Navaho material, etc., and, were
the dyes used of native origin, this designation would
be correct. Unfortunately, in by far the greater number
of them, aniline dyes are used, and this, by the wise
purchaser, is regarded as a misfortune. The next grade
is the native wool fancy. These are comparatively
rare blankets, as the yarn must be woven very tightly,
and the weaving also done with great care. The highest
grade that one will ordinary come in contact with
is the Germantown. This style of blanket is made
entirely of purchased Germantown yarn, which has
almost superseded the native wool fancy, as, to the
ordinary purchaser, a Germantown yarn blanket looks
so much better than one made from its Navaho counterpart.
The yarn is of brighter colors&mdash;necessarily so,
owing to the wonderful chromatic gamut offered by
the aniline dyes; it is spun more evenly (not necessarily
more strongly, and, indeed, as a matter of fact, is far
less strong), and (to the Indian) is much less trouble
to procure. Then, too, when woven, owing to its good
looks, it sells for more than the native wool fancy, upon
which so much more work has had to be put. Hence
Madam Navaho, being no fool, prefers to make what
the people ask for, and "Germantowns" are turned out
<i>ad libitum</i>.</p>

<p>But, to the knowing, there is still a higher grade of
blanket. This is not, as one expert (<i>sic</i>) would have
it, an attempted copying of ancient blankets, but a continuation
of an art which he declares to be lost. There
are several old weavers who preserve in themselves all
the old and good of the best days of blanket weaving.
They use native dyes, native wool,&mdash;with bayeta when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
they can get it,&mdash;and they spin their wool to a tension
that makes it as durable as fine steel. They weave
with care, and after the old fashions, following the
ancient shapes and designs, and produce blankets that
are as good as any that were ever made in the palmiest
days of the art. Such blankets take long in weaving,
and are both rare and expensive. I have just had one
of these fine blankets made (January, 1903), and in
every sense of the word it is equal to any old blanket I
ever saw.</p>

<p>The common blankets and the extra common are
sold by the pound, the price, of course, varying, and of
late years steadily increasing. Half-fancy blankets are
generally sold by the piece, and vary in price according
to the harmony of the colors, the fineness of the weave,
and the striking characteristics of the design. This is
also true of native wool fancy, the price being determined
by the Indian according to her notions of the length
of the purchaser's purse. On the other hand, Germantown
yarn having a fixed purchasable price, the blankets
made from it are to be bought by the pound.</p>

<p>These remarks, necessarily, refer to the original purchases
from the Indian. There are no general rules of
purchase price followed by traders, dealers, or retail
salesmen.</p>

<p>In the original colors, as I have already shown, there
are white, brown, gray, and black, the last rather a
grayish-black, or, better still, as Matthews describes it,
rusty. He also says: "They still employ to a great
extent their native dyes of yellow, reddish, and black.
There is good evidence that they formerly had a blue
dye; but indigo, originally introduced, I think, by the
Mexicans, has susperseded this. If they, in former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
days, had a native blue and a native yellow, they must
also, of course, have had a green, and they now make
green of their native yellow and indigo, the latter being
the only imported dye-stuff I have ever seen in use
among them.... The brilliant red figures in their finer
blankets were, a few years ago, made entirely of bayeta,
and this material is still (1881) largely used. Bayeta
is a bright scarlet cloth with a long nap, much finer in
appearance than the scarlet strouding which forms
such an important article in the Indian trade of the
North."</p>

<p>This bayeta or baize was unravelled, and the Indian
often retwisted the warp to make it firmer than originally,
and then rewove it into his incomparable blankets.</p>

<p>From information mainly gained by Mr. G. H. Pepper,
of the American Museum of Natural History, during
his three years' sojourn with the Navahoes as head of
the Hyde Exploring Expedition, I present the following
accounts of their native dyes. From the earliest
days the Navahoes have been expert dyers, their colors
being black, brick-red, russet, blue, yellow, and a
greenish-yellow akin to the shade known as old gold. To
make the black dye three ingredients are used; viz.,
yellow ochre, pinion gum, and the leaves and twigs of
the aromatic sumac (<i>Rhus aromatica</i>). The ochre is
pulverized and roasted until it becomes a light brown,
when it is removed from the fire and mixed with an
equal amount of pinion gum. This mixture is then
placed on the fire, and as the roasting continues it first
becomes mushy, then drier and darker, until nothing
but a fine black powder is left. In the meantime the
sumac leaves and twigs are being boiled, five or six
hours being required to fully extract the juices. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
both are somewhat cooled they are mixed, and almost
immediately a rich bluish-black fluid is formed.</p>

<p>For yellow dye the tops of a flowering weed (<i>Bigelovia
graveolens</i>) are boiled for several hours until
the liquid assumes a deep yellow color. As soon as
the dyer deems the extraction of the color juices nearly
complete, she takes some native alum (<i>almogen</i>) and
heats it over the fire, and, when it becomes pasty,
gradually adds it to the boiling decoction, which slowly
becomes of the required yellow color.</p>

<p>The brick-red dye is extracted from the bark and
roots of the sumac, and ground black alder bark, with
the ashes of the juniper as a mordant. She now immerses
the wool and allows it to remain in the dye
from half an hour to an hour.</p>

<p>Whence come the designs incorporated by these
simple weavers into their blankets, sashes, and dresses?
In this, as in basketry and pottery, the answer is found
in nature. Indeed, many of their textile designs suggest
a derivation from basketry ornamentation (which
originally came from nature), "as the angular, curveless
figures of interlaying plaits predominate, and the principal
subjects are the same&mdash;conventional devices
representing clouds, stars, lightning, the rainbow, and
emblems of the deities. But these simple forms are
produced in endless combination and often in brilliant,
kaleidoscopic grouping, presenting broad effects of
scarlet and black, of green, yellow, and blue upon
scarlet, and wide ranges of color skilfully blended upon
a ground of white. The centre of the fabric is frequently
occupied with tessellated or lozenge patterns
of multi-colored sides, or divided into panels of
contrasting colors in which different designs appear; some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
display symmetric zigzags, converging and spreading
throughout their length; in others, bands of high color
are defined by zones of neutral tints, or parted by
thin, bright lines into a checkered mosaic, and in many
only the most subdued shades appear. Fine effects are
obtained by using a soft, gray wool in its natural state,
to form the body of the fabric in solid color, upon
which figures in orange and scarlet are introduced; also
in those woven in narrow stripes of black and deep
blue, having the borders relieved in bright tinted
meanders along the sides and ends, or with a central
colored figure in the dark body, with the design
repeated in a diagonal panel at each corner.</p>

<p>"The greatest charm, however, of these primitive
fabrics, is the unrestrained freedom shown by the
weaver in her treatment of primitive conventions. To
the checkered emblem of the rainbow she adds sweeping
rays of color, typifying sunbeams; below the many-angled
cloud group, she inserts random pencil lines of
rain; or she softens the rigid meander, signifying lightning,
with graceful interlacing, and shaded tints. Not
confining herself alone to these traditional devices, she
invents her own methods to introduce curious, realistic
figures of common objects,&mdash;her grass brush, wooden
weaving fork, a stalk of corn, a bow, an arrow, or a
plume of feathers from a dancer's mask. Thus, although
the same characteristic styles of weaving and
decoration are general, yet none of the larger designs
are ever reproduced with mechanical exactness; each
fabric carries some distinct variation, some suggestion
of the occasion of its making, woven into form as the
fancy arose."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>I have thus quoted from an unpublished manuscript
of one of the greatest Navaho authorities of the United
States&mdash;Mr. A. M. Stephen&mdash;in order to confirm my
own oft-repeated and sometimes challenged statements
that the Navaho weaver finds in nature her designs, and
that in most of her better blankets there is woven "some
suggestion of the occasion of its making."</p>

<p>This imitative faculty is, <i>par excellence</i>, the controlling
force in aboriginal decoration so far as I know the
Amerind of the Southwest.</p>

<p>With many of the younger women, submission to the
imitative faculty in weaving is becoming an injury instead
of a blessing. Instead of looking to nature for
their models, or finding pleasure in the religious symbolism
of the older weavers, they have sunk into a lazy,
apathetic disregard, and they slavishly and carelessly
imitate the work of their elders. This is growingly
true, I am sorry to say, with both basket makers and
blanket weavers. On my recent trips I have come in
contact with many fair specimens, both in basketry and
blanketry, and when I have asked for an explanation of
the design the reply has been: "Me no sabe! I make
'em all same old basket, or all same old Navaho blanket."
Here is perversion of the true imitative faculty which
sought its pure and original inspiration from nature.</p>

<p>It will not be out of place here to correct a few general
misapprehensions in regard to the older and more valuable
Navaho blankets. These erroneous ideas are
partly the result of the misstatements of an individual
who sought thereby to enhance the value of his own
collection.</p>

<p>It is true that good bayeta blankets are comparatively
rare, but they are far more common than he would have
his readers believe. The word "bayeta" is nothing but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the simple Spanish for the English baize, and is spelled
bayeta, and not "balleta" or "vayeta." It is a bright
red baize with a long nap, made especially in England
for Spanish trade (not Turkish, as this "expert" claims),
and by the Spanish and Mexicans sold to the Indians.
Up to as late as 1893 bayeta blankets were being made
plentifully. Since then comparatively few have been
made. The bayeta was a regular article of commerce,
and could be purchased at any good wholesale house in
New York. It was generally sold by the rod, and not by
the pound. The duty now is so high that its importation
is practically prohibited, it being, I believe, about sixty
per cent. And yet I am personally acquainted with
several weavers who will imitate perfectly, in bayeta, any
blanket ever woven, and that the native dyes for other
colors will be used. We are told that an Indian woman
will not take the time to weave blankets such as were
made in the olden time. I have several that took nine,
twelve, and thirteen months to make, and if the pay is
good enough any weaver will work on a blanket a year,
or even two years, if necessary. The length of time
makes no difference, as several traders in Indian blankets
can vouch. Indeed, it would be quite possible to obtain
the perfect reproduction of any blanket in existence,
which would be satisfactory to any board of genuine
experts, the only differences between the new and the
ancient blankets being those inseparable from newness
and age.</p>

<p>While bayeta blankets are not common by any means,
they aggregate many scores in the mass, and are to be
found in many collections, both East and West. It is
a difficult matter to even suggest in a photograph or an
engraving any idea of the beauty and charm of one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
these old Navaho blankets.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><span class="smcap">Navaho Family and Hogan in the Painted

<p>It will be observed that I have written as if the major
portion of the weaving of Navaho blankets was done
by the women. Dr. Matthews, however, writing in or
before 1881, says that "there are ... a few men who
practise the textile art, and among them are to be found
the best artisans of the tribe." Of these men but one
or two are now alive, if any, and I have seen one only
who still does the weaving.</p>

<p>In late years a few Navaho weavers have invented
a method of weaving a blanket both sides of which are
different. The Salish stock of Indians make baskets
the designs of which on the inside are different from
those on the outside, but this is done by a simple process
of imbrication, easy to understand, which affords
no key to a solution of the double-faced Navaho blanket.
I have purchased two or three such blankets, but as yet
have not found a weaver who would show me the process
of weaving. Dr. Matthews thinks this new invention
cannot date farther back than 1893, as prior to that
time Mr. Thomas V. Keam, the oldest trader with the
Navahoes, had never seen one. Yet one collector declares
he had one as far back as fifteen years ago.</p>

<p>In addition to the products of the vertical loom the
Navaho and also the Pueblo women weave a variety of
smaller articles of wear, all of which are remarkable for
their strength and durability as well as for their striking
designs.</p>

<h2><a name="ChXI." id="ChXI."></a>CHAPTER XI<br />
<small>THE WALLAPAIS</small></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap">t</span> is hard to conceive of a people, numbering nearly
a thousand souls, lodged within the borders of the
United States, of whom nothing has been written. The
only references to the Wallapais are to be found in
the casual remarks of travellers or soldiers, and later, the
agent's reports to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs.
Perhaps the earliest reference to them is in Padre Garc&eacute;s'
Diary, where, in describing the Mohaves, he says the
Wallapais (spelling the name Jaguallapais) are their
enemies on the east. Then, on leaving the Mohaves
and journeying east, he himself reaches the tribe in the
neighborhood of where the town of Kingman now
stands. Six miles northwest of Kingman are located
Beale's Springs, which pour forth the best supply of
water in the whole region; hence it was natural that the
Wallapais should have established their homes near it.
In the Wallapai Origin Legend the story of their dispersion
to this region is told. The Wallapai Mountains are
close by, a few miles to the southeast, and from the
pines of these mountains they get their name; "Wal-la,"
tall pine; "pai," people,&mdash;the people of the tall pine.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Garc&eacute;s says the people received him hospitably and
"conducted themselves with me as comported with the
affection that I had shown toward them." Their dress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
was antelope skins and "some shirts of Moki," doubtless
the cotton woven shirts of these primitive weavers.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Ives, in his interesting report of his early
explorations in this region, describes the Wallapais in
Peach Springs and Diamond Canyons, another of their
favored locations, and Captain Bourke in his "On the
Border with Crook" makes passing mention of them.</p>

<p>On January 4, 1883, President Arthur decreed the
following as their reservation:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is hereby ordered that the following-described tract of
country situated in the Territory of Arizona be, and the same is
hereby, set aside and reserved for the use and occupancy of the
Hualapai Indians, namely: Beginning at a point on the Colorado
River five miles eastward of Tinnakah Spring; thence south
twenty miles to crest of high mesa; thence south forty degrees
east twenty-five miles to a point of Music Mountains; thence
east fifteen miles; thence north fifty degrees east thirty-five
miles; thence north thirty miles to the Colorado River; thence
along said river to the place of beginning; the southern boundary
being at least two miles south of Peach Spring, and the
eastern boundary at least two miles east of Pine Spring. All
bearings and distances being approximate.</p>

<p style="text-align: right;">"<span class="smcap">Chester A. Arthur.</span>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Owing to the abundant supply of water at Beale's
Springs the settlement there naturally became a
stopping-place for all travel across that portion of
Arizona. It was the favorite camping-place of the wagons
travelling between Fort Mohave and Fort Whipple, near
Ph&#630;nix. Johnson's and Gentile Springs also being in
line, and the pass just below Kingman leading into the
Sacramento Valley being the most natural outlet for a
railway, the building of the Atlantic and Pacific, by which
name the section of the great Santa F&eacute; transcontinental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
system which extends from Albuquerque, New Mexico,
to Barstow, California, was originally known&mdash;found
the Wallapais and at once put them in contact with the
outside world and our civilization. Unfortunately the
actual builders of a railway and their followers do not
always represent the best elements of our civilization,
and the meeting in this case was decidedly against the
best interests of the Wallapais. Close proximity, also,
to a border mining town, such as Kingman, has not
tended to the elevation of the morals or ideals of the
Wallapais, and in a short time many of those who resided
near the railways became known for their degradation.
The men yielded to the white men's vices and
soon inducted their women into the same courses, so
that for a long period of years the name Wallapai
seemed to be almost synonymous with drunkenness,
gambling, wild orgies, and the utmost degradation. In
those days it was no uncommon sight to see as many as
twenty men, women, and children lying around drunk
in either Kingman or Hackberry, and I have personal
knowledge of several cases where fathers took their
daughters and sold them to white men, into a bondage
infinitely worse and more degrading than slavery.</p>

<p>Of late years this condition has been largely improved.
When the government schools were established and a
field matron sent to work with the Wallapais, new
elements of our civilization were introduced to these
unfortunates, and nobly they have responded. With few
exceptions they are now industrious, sober, honest, and
reliable.</p>

<p>The Wallapais are of Yuman stock. In appearance
they more nearly resemble the Mohaves found at Parker,
on the reservation, than any other of the peoples in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
immediate region. They have the same stout, sturdy,
fleshy build, heavy faces, and general habits, though in
many respects they are a different people. They regard
the Havasupais as their cousins, and the speech of the
two peoples is very similar. Indeed any person who
can speak the one can easily be understood by one
who speaks the other.</p>

<p>According to their traditions, it was one of the mythical
heroes of the Wallapais&mdash;Pach-i-tha-a-wi&mdash;who
made the Grand Canyon. There had been a big flood
and the earth was covered with water. No one could
stir but Pach-i-tha-a-wi, and he went forth carrying a big
knife he had prepared of flint, and a large, heavy wooden
club. He struck the knife deep into the water-covered
ground and then smote it deeper and deeper with his club.
He moved it back and forth as he struck it further into the
earth, until the canyon was formed through which all the
water rushed out into the Sea of the Sunset. Then, as
the sun shone, the ground became hard and solid as we
find it to-day.</p>

<p>In physical appearance the Wallapais are a far coarser
and heavier type than the Navahoes. They are medium
in height, small-boned, and fat. Their features are
heavy and coarse. The nose is flat between the eyes
and broad at the base, and the nostrils large, denoting
good lung power and capacity. The septum is very large
and heavy. The cheek-bones generally are high and
prominent, and the chin well rounded, rather than square,
like that of most of the Navahoes. Their shoulders are
broad, with head set close in. Seldom is a long-necked
man or woman seen. The upper lips are full and the
under ones thick, with a slight droop at the corners.
The eyes are large and limpid, brown or black, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
capable of great seriousness or merry sparklings.
The foreheads are narrow, rounding off on each side.
The heads are round without any great fulness of the
back regions. Most of them have good teeth, white
and strong, though the use of white men's coffee, baking
powder, and other demoralizing foods and drinks,
have begun to work appreciable injury to them.</p>

<p>The women generally wear their hair banged over
the forehead, so that the eyebrows are almost covered,
and the rest of the hair is cut off level with the shoulders,
so that a well-combed head of hair falls heavily around
the whole head, covering the major part of the cheeks
and sides of the chin. I once made an interesting discovery
in regard to this almost complete covering up of
the face with the hair. I wished to make a photograph
of a woman I had long known and been friendly with.
As her eyes and face were scarcely distinguishable, I took
the liberty of putting back the hair from her cheeks.
She arose in anger, and for three years refused to speak
or meet me. I had given to her the most serious insult
a man could offer to a Wallapai woman. The hair is
coarse, thick, and black, though after a shampoo with
amole root it is silky and glossy. The men tie the
"banda" around the forehead and seldom wear a hat
except when in the towns of the white men.</p>

<p>As a rule both men and women have sweet and soft
voices, though a few are harsh and forbidding.</p>

<p>The tattoo is common. The work is done with pins,
and charcoal is rubbed in as the punctures are made.
This gives a bluish-black appearance which is permanent.
They also paint their faces in red, yellow, and
black. The chief purpose of both tattooing and painting
is to enhance their beauty, though there are times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
when the tattooing has a distinct significance.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><span class="smcap">The Winner of the "Gallo" Race at Tohatchi.</span></p>

<p>In school the boys and girls are slow but sure in their
learning. They read, write, spell, and figure with accuracy
and speed, and compare favorably with white
children in the rapidity of their progress. Most of the
schoolgirls are heavily built and coarse,&mdash;indeed, all but
two children, the daughters of Bi-cha (commonly
called Beecher), who are slim and slight.</p>

<p>In another chapter I have explained the charge that
Wallapai parents were unkind, even cruel to their
children. That charge can no longer be maintained.
They are kindness itself, as a rule, and from babyhood
up the children receive all the care of which the parents
deem them needful. Some of their babes are as chubby
and pretty and sweet-tempered as any I have ever
seen, and much fun have I had in photographing those
who were especially attractive to me. One mother
enjoyed my appreciation of her offspring and was most
good-natured in yielding to my desire to often photograph
her. The little one would coo and laugh and
kick her little feet and legs in merriment, or go to
sleep in my or her mother's arms, or even when standing
up in her wicker cradle. When I hung her up upon
the wall she soberly looked at me, but made no demonstration
of fear. Her mother, however, looked to see
what I was doing. I bade her gaze upon her child, and
the merry laugh she gave would have been an astonishment
to those who regard the Indian as dull, stolid,
expressionless.</p>

<p>Indeed one of the most laughing merry sprites it has
ever been my good fortune to know is a Wallapai
maiden of some eighteen years. Seldom is she seen
any other way than smiling or cheerily laughing. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
is a perfect witch for mischief and practical jokes, and is
never so happy as when she can perpetrate one upon a
white man whom she can trust. In that word "trust"
lies the whole key to the demeanor of an Indian,
either man, woman, or child, towards a white person.
If you are trusted the whole inner life is left open as a
clear page; if not, the book is closed, locked, sealed, and
the key thrown away.</p>

<p>I had long wished to photograph the Wallapais, but
they had always objected. When I arrived at Kingman
I sent Pu-chil-ow-a, the interpreter and policeman, to
call a powwow. I sent an express invitation to the
chiefs, Serum, Leve-leve, Sus-quat-i-mi, and Qua-su-la.
Serum was away at Mineral Park with a band of Wallapais
whose services he farms out to the mine owners,
Leve-leve was sick and not expected to live, but Sus-quat-i-mi
and Quasula would come.</p>

<p>We were permitted to use the schoolhouse, and just
about sunset I was busily engaged when there came a
loud rap at the door. I hastened to open it, and there
stood a dignified, well-built, slightly bearded, neatly
dressed man, who smiled and bowed with dignity and
courtesy. He wore a cap, and at first sight looked
more like a retired sea-captain than anything, so I responded
to his bow with the question as to what did I
owe the honor of his visit.</p>

<p>"Why, you sent for me!" he replied.</p>

<p>"I sent for you? When?"</p>

<p>Then he heartily laughed and exclaimed: "You no
sapogi me? I'm Sus-quat-i-mi, Wallapai Charley."</p>

<p>To say I was surprised was to put it mildly.</p>

<p>Later on Quasula, Big Water (Ha-jiv-a-ha), Eagle
Feather (Sa-ka-lo-ka), Acorn Flour (&#256;-t&#299;-na), Coyote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Eating Fish-gut (Ka-ha-cha-va), and other leading men
came, and we had quite an interesting meeting. I stated
to them my object in coming: "There are many of
your white brothers who live between the Great Waters
of the Sunrise and Sunset who wish to know more of
their red-faced brothers of the Painted Desert. I have
come for years among you to find out and to tell them.
When I speak of Quasula they ask me to tell what he
looks like, and I tell them as well as I can, but if I
could show them a sun-picture they would know so
much better than my words make clear. So I wish you
no longer to be as children and babes. I have made the
sun-pictures of Navahoes, Hopis, Havasupais, Apaches,
Pimas, Acomas, Paiutis, and others; why should I not
make yours?"</p>

<p>When they presented their superstitions, I reasoned
against them, and finally Quasula settled the whole
matter in my favor by rising and saying with great
dignity: "We have heard our brother with the white
face and black beard. He speaks in one way,&mdash;not in
two ways at once. His words breathe truth. We need
not fear the sun-picture. I will go to him to-morrow
and he shall make as many sun-pictures of me and my
family as he desires. I want him to be able to tell to
our white brothers who live by the Sunrise Sea all he
has learned of us. We are a poor, ignorant people, we
are few and do not know much. The white men are
many and they know as much as they are many. Let
them send more people to teach us and our children
and we will gladly welcome them. Some of our people
have been bad. Bad white men have made them worse.
We want the bad men to be kept away, but we will
welcome good white men, and our children shall learn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
from them and be wise."</p>

<p>Then Sus-quat-i-mi arose, and in heavy and somewhat
pompous speech said: "Many years ago our
white brother made my sun-picture at Peach Springs.
He has eaten tunas, mescal, pinion nuts, and corn at my
hawa. We have slept side by side under the same
stars, and the same wind has played with his beard and
my hair. I know him. He knows me. His words are
straight. When he made my sun-picture he said it
would do me no harm, and here I am, after several
snows, and I am as well as ever. He shall make more
sun-pictures of me to-morrow, and I will sing for him
and dance the war-dance of my people."</p>

<p>Big Water and the others followed and my aim was
accomplished. Next morning we set forth,&mdash;Puchilowa,
my friend and photographer, Mr. C. C. Pierce, of Los
Angeles, and myself,&mdash;laden down with four cameras
and an abundance of plates and films. We succeeded
in getting many photographs, some of which are here
reproduced. But at one camp, an old woman, the grandmother,
doubtless, of two children left in her care, refused
to be pictured. She covered herself up and bade
the children hide their faces, but their curiosity
overcame their fears and they were "caught."</p>

<p>Poor old Leve-leve and his wife were found, both of
them nearly blind, in their miserable hawa, a mile or
so from Kingman. I had some useful medicament for
their eyes, and although it hurt dreadfully, they both
patiently bore the pain while I gave their eyes treatment.
By the side of the old man was his gourd rattle,
which the shaman had left to help him drive away sickness,
and for hours the old man sat quietly singing and
rattling, endeavoring to get rid of the evil powers that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
were cursing him. While I made a picture of him in
the dark hut, his wife went into an inner room and soon
returned clad in an elaborately fringed apron of buckskin.
This was her ceremonial costume, made by Leve-leve for
her as the mother of the tribe, when she led the annual
dance of thanksgiving for the corn and melon harvest.</p>

<p>Sus-quat-i-mi was as good as his word, and I not
only secured some excellent photographs of him, but he
sang for me into the graphophone some of his ceremonial
songs.</p>

<p>The Wallapais' war-song is a stirring and exciting one,
and it conveys us back to the days when their primitive
weapons were in use. After an incitation to anger
against the foe it bids the warriors "get rocks and tie
them up in buckskins; make of them fierce and deadly
battle-hammers, with which smite and kill your foes.
Take the horns of the buck and sharpen them, and with
them seek the hearts of your enemies with blows skilful
and strong."</p>

<p>Puchilowa sang for me the Wallapai song on the
death of their chiefs. It is a weird, mournful melody,
which, however, I have not yet had time and opportunity
to transcribe from the graphophone. It says: "Our
chief, our father, our friend, is dead. His voice is silent,
his tread is silent. Come together, ye his friends, and
cry about with sorrow. Burn up his body that his
spirit may go to the world of spirits. Burn up his house
that his spirit may not long to stay around. Burn up
all his possessions that they may be with him in the
spirit world. Then let no one to whom he belonged
stay near the place where he died. Move away, that
his spirit may feel nothing to keep him to the earth."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>Hence it will be seen that the Wallapai is naturally a
believer in cremation. Indeed he still practises the
burning of his dead, except where white influences are
brought to bear. These influences are not altogether
a perfect good. There is no harm in burning the dead,
but, unfortunately, the general Indian belief is that the
goods of the deceased, his horses, his guns, his clothes,&mdash;indeed,
all his personal possessions, and the gifts of his
friends,&mdash;should also be burned to accompany him to
the spirit world. If this destruction of valuable property
could be arrested without interfering with the corporeal
cremation, it would be a good thing.</p>

<p>The thanksgiving song for harvest, though purely
Indian, is a much more cheerful melody. Puchilowa
gave me the words, as well as sang the song in the
graphophone, but he was unable to tell what the words
meant. "The old Indians gave me this song long time
ago. I sing it all 'a time at harvest. I no sapogi
(understand) what it means."</p>

<p>etc., <i>ad infinitum</i>.</p>

<p>There are three native policemen, engaged by the
Indian department, among the Wallapais,&mdash;Puchilowa,
(Jim Fielding), at Truxton; Su-jin&acute;-i-mi (Indian Jack),
at Kingman; and Wa-wa-ti&acute;-chi-mi, at Chloride. Each
receives ten dollars per month for his services. It was
the former who acted as interpreter during my last visit.</p>

<p>I had just finished making the photographs of Quasula
and one or two others, when an old woman and her
husband came in from the desert. As he sat waiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
for me to photograph him, he took some prickly pears
from his bundle and began to eat them. I had often
seen tourists from the East fill their fingers with the
almost invisible and countless spines of the prickly pear,
so I asked At-e-e how he gathered them. Picking up
a stick, he sharpened one end, thrust it into his fruit,
and, as if it were still on the tree, chopped it off with
his knife. Now, still holding it on the stick, he peeled
it and then handed it to me to eat. It is a slightly
sweet and acid fruit, dainty enough in flavor, but so
crowded with annoying small seeds as not to pay for the
trouble of separating them.</p>

<p>Elsewhere I have described the method of making
fire with the drill. While talking with Atee, to
whom I had given some tobacco which he twisted
into a cigarette, he suddenly asked me for a match. I
said I would give him a boxful if he would make
a fire without a match. In a minute he set to work.
He borrowed the walking cane of Puchilowa, which
had just the right kind of end to it, and then, getting
a piece of softer, half-rotten but very dry wood, he
bored a small hole in it. Now, taking the stick, he
placed the end of it into the hole, and then, rubbing
the stick between his hands, he made it revolve so rapidly
that in a minute or less a slight smoke could be
seen in the hole where the end of the stick was revolving.
Stopping for just a moment, he got some dry punk
and put it into the hole and around the end of the
stick and began to twirl it again, at the same time
gently blowing on the punk. In less time than it takes
me to write it he had got a spark. This he blew gently
until it became two, or three and more, and then with
a few pieces of shredded cedar bark he picked up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
sparks, blew them more and more until the bark was
ignited, and in five minutes he had a good camp-fire.</p>

<p>Mescal is one of the chief native foods of both Wallapais
and Havasupais. They call it vi-yal. It is made
in winter, when the plant is fullest of moisture. It is
a species of cactus that is treated as follows: A sharp
stick is thrust into the plant to see if it is soft and moist
enough. Then the outer leaves are cut off until the
white, pulpy, and fibrous masses inside are exposed.
This is the part used. It is cooked in large pits, ten or
more feet in diameter. A hole is dug in the ground, or
better still, in a mass of rocky d&eacute;bris. Plenty of wood
is laid in the hole, and this covered over with small
pieces of rock upon which the material to be cooked is
placed four or five feet high. This, in turn, is also
covered with small stones, grass, and dirt to keep in the
heat. The wood is then fired and allowed to burn for
two or more days. Then the dirt and grass are taken
off, and if the mass has cooked brown it is removed,
piled upon flat rocks, and then pounded by the women
into big flat sheets, three or four feet wide and twice as
long. Exposure in the sun rapidly dries it, when it is
folded up into two or three feet lengths, taken home,
and stored for winter use.</p>

<p>Sometimes the mescal is pounded and eaten raw, and
again it is pounded, soaked in plenty of water, partially
fermented, and the liquor used as a drink.</p>

<p>The fruit of the tuna (a-te-e) is sometimes pounded
and rolled into a large mass, dried, and put away for
future use. Thus prepared it will keep for a long time,
very often being brought out a year after, when the new
crop is nearly ripe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>Other natural vegetable foods of the Wallapais are
a black grass seed (a-gua-va), white grass seed (i-eh-la),
the acorn and the pinion nut (o-co-o).</p>

<p>The shamans and others sometimes take the jimson-weed
(smal-a-ga-to&acute;-a), pound it up, soak it, and drink
the decoction. It is a frightful drink, producing results
worse than whiskey. For a time the debauchee sees
visions and dreams dreams, then he becomes crazy and
frantic, and then, exhausted, tosses in a quieter delirium
until restored to his senses, to be nervously racked for
days afterwards. The Havasupais are so bitter against
its use that their children are brought up to regard it
as one of the most dangerous and evil of plants.</p>

<p>Until Miss Calfee, of the Indian Association, was sent
to work among the Wallapais, they had so entirely
neglected the art of basket weaving as to let it almost
entirely die out amongst them. By her endeavors,
however, it has been resuscitated, and now there are
quite a number of fairly good Wallapai baskets made.
The inordinate love of bright colors manifested by the
average white tourist&mdash;note I say tourist, and not
Indian&mdash;is so completely perverting the taste of the
Wallapais as to render it almost impossible to buy a
basket which contains only the primitive colors. These
are mainly the white of the willow and the black of the
martynia. A straw-color, a yellow, and a red are also
native with them, the dyes being vegetable and mineral
secured from plants, roots, and rocks close at hand.
Some of the younger girls have set themselves to learn
the art, and one of them is already most successful.
She is a bright and cheerful maiden, and the basket she
holds in her lap is of her own manufacture. The design
is worked out in martynia. It represents the plateaus
and valleys of her home, and the inverted pyramid is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
the tornado or cyclone. It is her prayer to Those Above
to keep the cyclone in the centre of the plateaus so that
no injury may be done to her parents' corn-fields,
melon-patches, and peach-trees which are in the canyon
depths.</p>

<p>The Wallapais have had the same trouble about the
white man seizing the best land on their reservation
that most other tribes have been subject to. When the
reserve was set apart by executive order a man named
Spencer was living on land included therein, and he
claimed two of the finest of the springs, one, that of
Mattaweditita, being their most sacred of places. He was
soon murdered, whether by Indians or whites I am
unable to say, and no one occupied these springs until
a man named W. F. Grounds, regardless of the executive
order, took possession of, and claimed, Mattaweditita
to the exclusion of the Wallapais. This he sold to
a man named J. W. Munn. Later he and Munn had
quarrels about it and both claimed it. Then the Indian
Agent interfered, and, finding that the Indians had always
claimed it as their own, that it was on their reserve,
and that they actually wished to continue to cultivate
it, he ordered both men to leave. Grounds had about
seventy-five head of cattle and Munn had a garden. The
latter vacated quietly, but Grounds brought back his
cattle after they were removed. In the meantime the
Indians had planted their gardens, and when the cattle
came in their crops were speedily demolished. Again the
cattle were removed and again brought back. About
this time some one generously gave to the Indians, or
left where they could be picked up, some melons or
cucumbers or both, of which fourteen of the Wallapais
living in Mattaweditita Canyon partook. Of the fourteen,
thirteen sickened and died. Of course there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
no way of fastening this dastardly and cowardly crime
upon any one, but whites as well as Indians are pretty
generally agreed as to who was its perpetrator.</p>

<p>The few remaining Indians were now given wire to
fence in the canyon, but the old animals of Grounds'
herds pushed the wires down in their eagerness to get to
and eat the Indians' wheat. The trails were now fenced,
and this proved an effectual bar. Later this exemplary
white man turned a band of saddle horses into an Indian's
garden on the reservation for pasturage. This brought
upon him an order of exclusion from the reservation
and a command to entirely remove his stock within
a year. Whether this has been done or not I am unable
to say, although the Department at Washington confirmed
the order and required that it be done.</p>

<p>During all this squabbling it can well be imagined
how the crops of the Indian suffers; but what must be
his conception of white men, their government, and their
justice?</p>

<h2><a name="ChXII." id="ChXII."></a>CHAPTER XII<br />
<small>THE ADVENT OF THE WALLAPAIS</small></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap">n</span> the days of the long ago, when the world was
young, there emerged from Shi-p&aacute;-pu two gods, who
had come from the underworld, named To-cho-pa and
Ho-ko-ma-ta. When these brothers first stood upon
the surface of the earth, they found it impossible to
move around, as the sky was pressed down close to the
ground. They decided that, as they wished to remain
upon the earth, they must push the sky up into place.
Accordingly, they pushed it up as high as they could
with their hands, and then got long sticks and raised it
still higher, after which they cut down trees and pushed
it up higher still, and then, climbing the mountains,
they forced it up to its present position, where it is out
of reach of all human kind, and incapable of doing them
any injury.</p>

<p>While they were busy with their labors, another
mythical hero appeared on the scene, on the north side
of the Grand Canyon, not far from the canyon that is
now known as Eldorado Canyon. Those were the
"days of the old," when the animals had speech even
as men, and in many things were wiser than men. The
Coyote travelled much and knew many things, and he
became the companion of this early-day man, and
taught him of his wisdom. This gave the early man
his name, Ka-that-a-ka-na-ve, which means "Told or
Taught by the Coyote."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>For long they lived together, until the man began
to grow lonesome. He no longer listened to the
speech of the Coyote, and that made the animal sad.
He wondered what could be done to bring comfort to
his human friend, and at length suggested that he consult
Those Above. Kathat-a-kanave was lonesome because
there were none others of his kind to talk to.
He longed for human beings, so, accepting the advice
of the Coyote, he retired to where he could speak freely
to Those Above of his longings and desires. He was
listened to with attention, and there told that nothing
was easier than that other men, with women, should be
sent upon the earth. "Build a stone hawa&mdash;stone
house&mdash;not far from Eldorado Canyon, and then go
down to where the waters flow and cut from the banks
a number of canes or sticks. Cut many, and of six
kinds. Long thick sticks and long thin sticks;
medium-sized thick sticks and medium-sized thin sticks;
short thick sticks and short thin sticks. Lay these
out carefully and evenly in the stone hawa, and when
the darkest hour of the night comes, the Powers of
the Above will change them into human beings. But,
beware, lest any sound is made. No voice must speak,
or the power will cease to work."</p>

<p>Gladly Kathat-a-kanave returned to the stone house,
and with a hearty good-will he cut many canes or
sticks. He carried them to the house, and laid them out
as he had been directed, all the time accompanied by the
Coyote, who rejoiced to see his friend so cheerful and
happy. Kathat-a-kanave told Coyote what was to occur,
and Coyote rejoiced in the wonderful event that was
about to take place. When all was ready Kathat-a-kanave
was so wearied with his arduous labors that he
retired to lie down and sleep, and bade Coyote watch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
and be especially mindful that no sound of any kind
whatever issued from his lips. Coyote solemnly pledged
himself to observe the commands,&mdash;he would not cease
from watching, and not a sound should be uttered.
Feeling secure in these promises, Kathat-a-kanave
stretched out and was soon sound asleep. Carefully
Coyote watched. Darker grew the night. No sound
except the far-away twho! twho! of the owl disturbed
the perfect stillness. Suddenly the sticks began to
move. In the pitch blackness of the house interior,
Coyote could not see the actual change, the sudden
appearing of feet and legs and hands and arms and
head, and the uprising of the sticks into perfect men
and women, but in a few moments he had to stand
aside, as a torrent of men, women, and children poured
out of the doorway. Without a word, but thrilled even
to the tip of his tail with delight, he examined men,
women, youths, maidens, boys, girls, and found them all
beautifully formed and physically perfect. Still they
came through the door. Several times he found himself
about to shout for joy, but managed to restrain
his feelings. More came, and as they looked around
them on the wonderful world to which they had come
from nothingness, and expressed their astonishment
(for they were able to speak from the first moment),
Coyote became wild with joy and could resist the inward
pressure no longer. He began to talk to the new
people, and to laugh and dance and shout and bark
and yelp, in the sheer exuberance of his delight. How
happy he was!</p>

<p>Then there came an ominous stillness. The movements
from inside the house ceased; no more humans
appeared at the doorway. Almost frozen with terror,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Coyote realized what he had done. The charm had
ceased. Those Above were angry at his disobedience
to their commands.</p>

<p>When Kathat-a-kanave awoke he was delighted to
see the noble human beings Those Above had sent to
him, but when he entered the hawa his delight was
changed to anger. There were hundreds more sticks
to which no life had been given. Infuriated, he turned
upon Coyote and reproached him with bitter words for
failing to observe his injunction, and then, with fierce
anger, he kicked him and bade him begone! His tail
between his legs, his head bowed, and with slinking
demeanor, Coyote disappeared, and that is the reason all
coyotes are now so cowardly, and never appear in the
presence of mankind without skulking and fear.</p>

<p>As soon as they had become a little used to being on
the earth, Kathat-a-kanave called his people together
and informed them that he must lead them to their
future home. They came down Eldorado Canyon,
and then crossed Hackataia (the Grand Canyon) and
reached a small but picturesque canyon on the Wallapai
reservation, called Mat-ta-wed-it-i-ta. This is
their "Garden of Eden." Here a spring of water
supplies nearly a hundred miners' inches of water, and
there are about a hundred acres of good farming land,
lying in such a position that it can well be irrigated
from this spring. On the other side of the canyon is
a cave about a hundred feet wide at its mouth, and
perched fully half a thousand feet above the valley.</p>

<p>Now Kathat-a-kanave disappears in some variants of
the story, and Hokomata and Tochopa take his place at
Mattaweditita. The latter is ever the hero. He gave
the people seeds of corn, pumpkins, melons, beans, etc.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
and showed them how to plant and irrigate them. In
the meantime they had been taught how to live on grass
seeds, the fruit of the tuna (prickly pear), and mescal,
and how to slay the deer, antelope, turkey, jack-rabbit,
cottontail, and squirrel.</p>

<p>When the crops came Tochopa counselled them not
to eat any of the product except such as could be
eaten without destroying the seeds,&mdash;the melons and
pumpkins,&mdash;so that when planting time came they
had an abundance. When the next harvest was ripe
the crops were large, and after picking out the best for
seeds, some were stored away in the cave as a reserve
and the remainder eaten. As the years went on they
increased in numbers and strength. Tochopa was ever
their good friend and guide. He taught them how to
dance and smoke and rattle when they became sick;
he gave them <i>toholwa</i>&mdash;the sweat-house&mdash;to cure them
of all evil; he taught the women how to make pottery,
baskets, and blankets woven from the dressed skins of
rabbits. The men he taught how to dress buckskin,
and hunt and trap all kinds of animals good for food.
Thus they came almost to worship him and be ever
singing his praises. This made Hokomata angry. He
went away and sulked for days at a time. In his solitude
he evidently thought out a plan for wreaking his
jealous fury upon Tochopa and those who were so fond
of him. There was one family, the head of which was
inclined to be quarrelsome, and Hokomata went and
made special friends with him. He taught the children
how to make pellets of clay, and put them on the end
of sticks and then shoot them. Soon he showed them
how to make a dart, then a bow and arrow, and later
how to take the horn of a deer, put it in the fire until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
it was softened so that it could be moulded to a sharp
point. This made a dangerous dagger. Finally he
wrapped buckskin around a heavy stone, and put a
handle to it, thus making a war-club; took a rock and
made a battle-hammer of it; and still another, the edge
of which he sharpened so that a battle-axe was provided.
In the meantime he had been stealthily instilling
into the hearts of his friends the feelings of hatred
and jealousy that possessed him. He taught the children
to shoot the mud pellets at the children of other
families. He supplied the youths with slings, and bows
and arrows, and soon stones and arrows were shot at
unoffending workers. Protestations and quarrels ensued,
the fathers and mothers of the hurt children being
angry. Hokomata urged his friends to defend their
children, and they took their clubs, battle-hammers
and axes, and fell upon those who complained. Thus
discord and hatred reigned, and soon the two sides
were involved in petty war. Tochopa saw Hokomata's
movements with horror and dread. He could not
understand why he should do these terrible things.
Yet when the people came to him with their complaints
he felt he must sympathize with them. The trouble
grew the greater the population became, until at last
it was unbearable. Then Tochopa determined on stern
measures. Stealthily he laid his plan before the heads
of the families. Each was to leave the canyon, under
the pretext of going hunting, gathering pinion nuts,
grass seeds, or mescal, and go in different directions.
Then at a certain time they were all to gather at a
given spot, and there provide themselves with weapons.
Everything was done as he had planned, the
quarrellers&mdash;the Wha-jes&mdash;remaining behind with Hokomata.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Then, one night, the whole band, well armed, returned
stealthily to the canyon and fell upon the quarrellers.
Many were slain outright, and all the remainder driven
from the home they had cursed. Not one was allowed
to remain. Thus the Wha-jes became a separate people.
White men to-day call them Apaches, but they are
really the Wha-jes, the descendants of the quarrelsome
people the Wallapais drove out of Mattaweditita
Canyon.</p>

<p>Hokomata was furious. He was conquered, but led
his people to settle not far away, and many times they
returned to the canyon and endeavored to kill all they
could. Thus warfare became common. The spear was
invented,&mdash;a long stick with a sharpened point of flint.
Sometimes the Wha-jes would come in large numbers,
when many of the men were away hunting. Then all
the attacked would flee to the cave before mentioned&mdash;which
they still call Kathat-a-kanave's Nyu-wa (Cave
House)&mdash;where they built an outer wall of fortification,
and farther back still another. Several times the outer
wall was stormed and taken, but never could the Wha-jes
penetrate to the inner part of the cave, so to this day
it is termed Wa-ha-vo,&mdash;the place that is impregnable.</p>

<p>After many generations had passed, Hokomata saw
it was no use keeping his people near the canyon;
they could never capture it, and they had lost all desire
to become again part of the original people, so he led
them away to the southeast, beyond the San Francisco
Mountains, down into what is now southern Arizona
and New Mexico. Here they settled down somewhat
and became the Apache race, though they are still
Wha-jes&mdash;quarrellers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>Left to themselves, the families in Mattaweditita increased
rapidly, until soon there were too many to live
in comfort. So Tochopa took most of them to Milkweed
Canyon, and then he divided the separate families
and allotted to each his own territory. To the Mohaves
he gave the western region by the great river; the
Paiutis he sent to the water springs and pockets of
southern Nevada and Utah; the Navahoes went east
and found the great desert region, where game was
plentiful; and the Hopis, who were always afraid and
timid, built houses like Kathat-a-kanave's fortress on
the summit of high mountains or mesas. The Havasupais
started to go with the Hopis, and they camped
together one night in the depths of the canyon where
the blue water flows to Hackataia&mdash;the Colorado.
The following morning when they started to resume
their journey a child began to cry. This was an omen
that bade them remain, so that family stayed and became
known as the Haha-vasu-pai, the people of the
Blue Water. Most of the remaining families went into
the Mountains of the Tall Pine, south of Kingman, and
thus became known as the pai (people) of the walla
(tall pines). Here they found plenty of food of all
kinds and abundance of game. As they increased in
numbers they spread out, some going to Milkweed,
others to Diamond and Peach Springs Canyons, and
wherever they could find food and water.</p>

<p>Thus was the human race begun and the Wallapais
established in their home.</p>

<p>When I asked where the white race came from, old
Leve-leve scratched his head for a moment and then
declared that they were made from the left-over sticks
in Kathat-a-kanave's house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>But the Apaches, under Hokomata, would not leave
the various peoples at peace. They warred upon them
all the time. And that is why the Wallapai parents of
a later day became accused of cruelty to their children.
Scattered about, a few here and a few there, they were
fit subjects for Apache attacks. A code of smoke
signals, for warning, was adopted, but it was not always
possible to prevent surprises. Sometimes the father of
a family would go hunting and it would not be possible
for the mother and children to go along. If she
were attacked under such conditions, what could she
do? If she tried to escape, hampered with her little
ones, they would all be caught and she would have to
submit to her captors and stand by and see them ruthlessly
murdered. So she preferred to kill them herself,
which she often did by strangling or suffocation. Then
she might hope to reach the mountains and hide until
the cover of night gave her an opportunity to escape.
This explanation has actually been given to me as a
statement of fact by some of the older women of the
tribe.</p>

<p>Sometimes when the Apaches would attempt a raid
they would be checkmated, the tables turned, and they
themselves captured. Then there were great rejoicings.
A feast was invariably held, at which the scalps were
exposed on a pole around which the dances were conducted
in the light of immense fires.</p>

<p>Of late years both Apaches and Wallapais have been
taught to bury their enmity. Acting upon the suggestion
of former agent Ewing, the Wallapai chiefs sent a
messenger of peace and invitation to the Apache chiefs,
asking them to come and visit the Wallapais during
watermelon and green corn time, and be friends as the
Great Father at Washington desires. Yet the Apaches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
though the invitation has been several times repeated,
have never come. They remember "the days of the
years gone by,"&mdash;the days of murder, rapine, scalpings,
and stealings of women. And they are afraid that
poison, treachery, sudden death, torture perhaps, lurk
behind the seeming friendliness. Revenge is sweet to
an Indian, and the Apache cannot conceive that so great
a conversion has taken place in the Wallapai heart as
to lead him to forego his just revenge.</p>

<p>When first known to the white man they were found
inhabiting the region they now occupy, including the
Wallapai (sometimes spelled Hualapai), Yavapai, and
Sacramento Valleys. Their chief mountain ranges
were the Cerbab, Wallapai, Aquarius, and northern
portion of Chemehuevi ranges. They roamed as far
south as Bill Williams' Fork of the Colorado, and
its branch, the Santa Maria. They then numbered
about the same as they do now, between six and seven
hundred.</p>

<p>In Coues' translation of Garc&egrave;s' Diary Prof. F. W.
Hodge gives other forms of spelling the name of the
Wallapais, as follows: "Hah-w&aacute;l-coes, Haulapais, Ha-wol-la
Pai, Ho-allo-pi, Hualpais, Hualapais, Hualipais,
Hualopais, Hualp&aacute;itch, Hualpas, Hualpias, Huallapais,
Hulapais, Hwalapai, Jagullapai (after Garc&eacute;s), Jaguyapay,
Jaqualapai, Jaguallapai, Tiquillapai, Wallapais,
Wil-ha-py-ah."</p>

<p>These and the various names given to the Wallapais
show the difficulties explorers encounter in endeavoring
correctly to spell the names they hear. It should never
be forgotten that the Amerinds of the Southwest speak
with quite as great a latitude in pronunciation as is
found in the wonderfully varied dialects of the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
language. To make all these different pronunciations
conform to a standard American method is one part
of the grand work of the Geographical Board, a much
abused but highly necessary public body.</p>

<h2><a name="ChXIII." id="ChXIII."></a>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<small>THE PEOPLE OF THE BLUE WATER AND THEIR HOME</small></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="smcap">f</span> no people of the Southwest, perhaps, has so
much utter nonsense been written as of this interesting
People of the Blue Water, the <i>pai</i> (people) of the
<i>vasu</i> (blue) <i>haha</i> (water)&mdash;the Havasupais. As far as
we know, Padre Garc&eacute;s was the first white man to visit
them in their Cataract Canyon home, and he speaks of
his visit in his interesting Diary translated and annotated
by the lamented Elliott Coues shortly before his death.</p>

<p>Captain Sitgreaves, Lieutenant Ives, Captain Palfrey,
Major J. W. Powell, Lieut. F. H. Cushing, and others
in turn visited them, but very little was either known
or written about them when, over a dozen years ago,
I was conducted to their marvellously picturesque home
by Mr. W. W. Bass, the well-known guide of the Grand
Canyon.</p>

<p>The journey on that occasion was a remarkable one for
me, as, though I was fairly well versed in the trails of the
Grand Canyon (having then descended four of them),
I had never seen such a trail as was the Topocobya Trail
down which we descended late in the evening. Leaving
our wagon, after sixteen miles' drive through the
Kohonino Forest from Bass Camp, we packed food,
blankets, and cameras on horses and burros, and, after
two miles of travel in what in Western parlance is called
a "draw," the real head of the trail was reached. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
walked in the closing dusk of day to the edge of the
precipice and looked off to where our guide told us we
must shortly be travelling. Far below, almost a thousand
feet, without the sign of a trail, it seemed as if he
must be hoaxing us. Soon, however, as we followed him,
we found ourselves on a rocky shelf, and then began the
most stupendous series of zigzags I had ever been on.
Back and forth we wended, our trail a mere scratch on
the rocky slope, here descending rugged steps, where
a misstep meant sure and awful death. Higher and
higher the walls rose around us; darker and darker
grew the night; more weird and awesome the wind and
weather carved figures sculptured on the sides and
summits of the walls, and still down we went. At last we
reached a vast cavernous-like place where Topocobya
Spring is located. A small flow of water comes from
the solid rock, and there we watered our horses and
filled up our canteens prior to advancing on our
seemingly never-ending descent. At last we reached the
level, and there, lighting a fire, made camp and rested
before penetrating farther into the deep and mystic
recesses of the Havasupais. Early in the morning we
began the farther descent. Mile after mile we traversed,
first riding on the dry bed of the winter stream, then
entering the narrower walls formed by the erosion of
centuries through first one stratum of rock, then another.
Now we were riding on a narrow shelf, on one
side of which was a high wall, and on the other a deep,
narrow ravine, in the bottom of which the erosive forces
have cut a number of holes,&mdash;small troughs or bath
tubs in the sandstone, where during the rainy season
pools of delicious water may be found. In a short time
we were riding up or down literal stairways cut in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
rock, or rounding "Cape Horns," where we held our
breath at the dreadful consequences that would ensue
were horse or man to slip. Entering Rattlesnake
Canyon our whole course was on a shelving slope of
rock, over which even experienced horses tread gingerly.
At last we came to the bed of the main canyon, and
then for five or six miles we journeyed on, in the sand
or the gravelly wash, for the stream that flows through
this narrow canyon in storm times has no other law than
its own wilful force. To-day we ride in one place,
to-morrow's storm changes everything. After numberless
twinings and twistings, all of which, however, gave a
persistent northwesterly direction to our travelling, we
came in sight of a score or so of large and fine cottonwood
trees, whose height far surpassed the smaller mesquite,
cottonwood, and other trees that line much of the
canyon's bed. These large trees told us our journey
was practically at an end, for here begins the outpouring
of the numberless springs that make the stream we
can already hear rushing in its pebbly bed lower down.
Without any premonition they spring out in large and
small volume at the foot of some of these trees, and the
Havasu&mdash;the Blue Water&mdash;is made. Every few yards
adds to the water's volume, for more springs empty
their flow into it. The first and only real buildings are
the schoolhouse and the homes of the farmer and
teachers, and then, at once, begin the small farms of
the Havasupais.</p>

<p>Stand on the slope here, where a mass of talus rises
from the trail side, so that we can survey the whole of
the picturesque scene. Note its setting! Towering
walls of regularly laminated red sandstone, though the
layers are of differing thicknesses, wind in and out, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
if following the meandering course of the stream, and
over this the perfect blue of the Arizona sky. These
make the most marvellously picturesque dwelling-place
of America. Even Acoma's mesa heights and Walpi's
precipice-surrounded walls are not more picturesque,
and when you add the charm of the verdure nourished
by the sweet waters of the Havasu, the picture is complete
in its unique attractiveness.</p>

<p>Not even in the Green Emerald Isle, or the county
of Devonshire, or the vineyards of France, is richer
verdure to be found than fills up the open space between
these great walls. Willows reveal the winding path of
the Havasu, and everywhere else are the fields of the
Indians. Patches of corn, watermelons, squash, canteloupes,
beans, sunflowers, chili, onions, and alfalfa, with
here and there peach, mesquite, and cottonwood trees,
abound. As a rule these patches are protected and set
off one from another by hedges of wattled willows or
fences of rudely placed cottonwood poles. Through
the fields trails meander in every direction, and they are
also "cut up" by irrigating ditches. Some of the better
irrigated fields are divided into small sections&mdash;like the
squares of a checker-board&mdash;in order that the water
may be more systematically distributed.</p>

<p>The peaceful <i>hawas</i> of the Havasupais nestle here
and there among these verdant growths. Themselves
covered with willows, it is often hard to distinguish them
from the trees, were it not that at our approach small
groups of men, women, and children, some clad in flaming
red, others in all the colors of the rainbow, and some
in even less than Mark Twain's descriptive smile, stand
forth and reveal the dwelling-places. Now and again
the curling line of bluish smoke of the camp-fire reveals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the hawa, and we gladly avail ourselves of one or the
other of these marks of identification to make ourselves
more familiar with the real home of the Havasupais.
After investigation we find there are several distinct
types of houses, all simple and primitive, and yet each
different from the other.</p>

<p>Chickapanagie's summer home is a type of the simplest
character. Two upright poles with forks at the
top, standing about six feet high, are placed in line with
each other fifteen feet apart. A cross-beam is placed
on these uprights. Then a row of poles, about eight
to nine feet in length, is sloped against the cross-beam.
These are covered with willows, and there is the completed
hawa.</p>

<p>What queer dwelling-places men have, and ever have
had, and possibly ever will have. At the Paris Exposition
of 1889 one whole street was devoted to a history
of inhabited dwellings. At one end were the earliest
"homes" of the paleolithic age, caves and huts, followed
by the Lake Dwellings and the wickiups, tepees,
or tents of the present-day Indian, the latter being the
same primitive structures the aborigines have ever used.
The other end of the street was devoted to the domestic
architecture of our own day, and there, in a few hours,
one could study almost every known form of home
structure. But who could ever reproduce some of the
homes these Havasupais live in? Wicker huts in the
open, and caves in the faces of solid sandstone walls
two thousand feet and more in height, these in turn
surmounted by domes and obelisks and towers and cupolas
that no modern architect dare attempt to rival.</p>

<p>These massive walls absorb the heat of the sun in
summer time and thus keep the canyon intensely hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
both night and day. The large flow of water and
the dense growth of willows and other verdure keep
the soil constantly moist, so there is a humidity in the
atmosphere which, in hot weather, makes it very oppressive.</p>

<p>This moisture renders the canyon cold in winter,
although the thermometer never ranges very low. Snow
falls but seldom, and then disappears almost as soon as
it lights. In 1898 there was snow that stayed on the
ground for several hours, but this was one of the severest
winters they have had for many years.</p>

<p>A hundred yards or so below where the springs commence
to flow Wallapai Canyon enters from the left.
It is similar in appearance to, though narrower than,
Havasu (Cataract) Canyon, the walls being of red sandstone,
the strata of which are as regular as if laid by
masons. A few hundred yards beyond the junction of
the two canyons a remarkable piece of Indian engineering
is in evidence, showing how the Indians ascend
from a lower to an upper platform. There is a drop
here in the stratum of some twenty-five or thirty feet,
and to overcome this obstacle the Havasupais built a
cage with logs which they filled with stones, and then
from this stretched rude logs up and across, to which
other logs were fastened, thus making a fairly substantial
bridge from the lower to the upper stratum over
which their horses as well as themselves could safely
pass. The trail from this point ascends through tortuous
canyons a distance of seven miles to the territory occupied
by the Wallapais.</p>

<p>Just below the entrance to Wallapai Canyon a vast
mass of talus has fallen, and two hundred yards farther
down, the Cataract Canyon trail goes over a portion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
this talus to avoid the creek, which has here crossed
from the other side of the canyon and has become a
rapidly flowing stream some two feet or more in depth.
Attached to this talus is a large mass of solid concrete
made of pebbles, rocks, and sand that have been washed
down in the creek and made cohesive by the lime from
the water. Here the canyon narrows again and the
stupendous walls seem very near to the willow-fringed
stream and the small fields. A few hundred feet farther
it opens out again, and as one rides on the trail he gets
exquisite views of the gray stone walls superposed on
the red sandstones to the northwest. These gray and
creamy sandstones, with their numerous and delicate
tints and shades, afford most delightful contrasts to the
glaring and monotonous red of the walls beneath. From
this point we gain our first view of the so-called
Havasupai stone gods, named by them "Hue-gli-i-wa," the
story of which is told elsewhere.</p>

<p>These rocky pillars with their supporting walls seem
as if they were once a part of a great wall that entirely
spanned the canyon, the towers being sentinel outlooks
to guard from attack both above and below. The portion
of the wall to the right, as one descends the canyon,
has been washed away, but the tower-crowned mass to
the left still preserves a broad sweep into the very heart
of the canyon as if it would bar all further progress.
Following the sweep of this curve and passing the wall
immediately underneath the outermost of the two towers,
we view from the trail which ascends a mass of talus
at this point another widened-out part of the canyon,
which seems entirely covered with willows, here and
there overshadowed by a few straggling cottonwoods.
This is where the ceremonial dances of the Havasupais<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
take place.</p>

<p>On the summit of the wall on the other side of the
canyon from the Hue-gli-i-wa are two stone objects, one
named Hue-a-pa-a, and the one farther down the canyon,
Hue-pu-keh-i. These are great objects of reverence,
for they represent the ancestors of the Havasupai
race. Hue-a-pa-a&mdash;the man&mdash;has a child upon his
back and two more by his side, and he is calling to his
wife&mdash;Hue-pu-keh-i&mdash;to hurry along, as the baby is
hungry and needs his dinner. The full breasts of the
stone woman show that she is a nursing mother.</p>

<p>Slightly below these stone figures, and on the right-hand
side of the canyon, is the old fort, where in the
days of fighting the Havasupais were wont to retire
when attacked. The fort is impregnable on three sides,
being precipitous, and on the fourth is accessible only
up a narrow trail, which is guarded by piles of rocks
which are ready to be tumbled, even by a woman, upon
the heads of foes who attempt to ascend. The fortifications
and stones for defence still remain, but it is
many years since they were used for their original
purposes.</p>

<p>One's mind becomes very active as he looks upon
this tribe of Indians and thinks of their traditions, history,
and life. So far, their almost entirely isolated
condition has been their preservation, although, sad to
say, much of their earlier contact with our civilization
was not of the best character.</p>

<p>Even in this land of our boasted Christianity it is true
that the strong prey upon the weak. The domination
of physical force is giving way to the domination of
mental force, but which is the greater evil? Why
should the man born with a mental advantage over his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
fellows exercise that advantage any more than the man
born with a physical advantage? We have not quite
ceased to worship the Sullivans, the Corbetts, and the
Fitzsimmonses, and, where we have, we have transferred
our worship to the intellectually strong, many of whom
are no more worthy our homage than the prize fighters.
So now it is the intellectually strong who prey upon
the intellectually weak, and, as in the physical conflict,
it is inevitable that the weak "go to the wall." In
simple cunning the Havasupai Indian may be our
superior, but in deep craft he is "out of the field."
His bow and arrow tipped with obsidian or flint pitted
against our repeating rifle; his rolling of heavy rocks
opposed to our Gatling guns; his mule and burro against
our iron horse; and his pine torch against our electric
light,&mdash;all demonstrate him to be in his intellectual
minority, or at an intellectual disadvantage. He makes
a fine figure in our romances, but I sadly fear that
the knell of his doom has sounded, and that a few
generations hence he will be no more.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><span class="smcap">Havasupai Fortress and Hue-gli-i-wa,

<p>Wallapai and Havasu Canyons, far more than the
Grand Canyon, meet the popular idea as to what a
canyon is. Their walls are narrow and precipitous,
and one staying in their depths must be content with a
late sunrise and an early sunset. Just above the rude
bridge before described are several natural reservoirs of
water. Here the canyon is not more than from one
hundred and fifty to two hundred and fifty feet wide.
This close proximity of the walls, which fairly overshadow
one, compels one to feel his insignificance far
more than when he stands in the wider and more comprehensive
vastness of the Grand Canyon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>From leading Havasupais I learn that many years
ago the various tribes of this region were at war
one with another, until finally a treaty of peace was
entered into and boundaries defined. The Paiutis were
to remain in Nevada and Utah and not cross the
Colorado River, the Wallapais had their region to the
west of Havasu Canyon, the Mohaves, Hopis, Pimas,
Apaches, Navahoes, Chimehuevis, and the rest their prescribed
limits, over which they were not to go without
permission from the chiefs into whose territory they
wished to pass. And, generally speaking, this treaty
has been observed.</p>

<p>Of the exquisitely beautiful waterfalls that give the
commonly accepted name to Havasu Canyon, viz.,
Cataract Canyon, I have not space here to treat. I
have already somewhat fully described them in my
book on the Grand Canyon.</p>

<h2><a name="ChXIV." id="ChXIV."></a>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<small>THE HAVASUPAIS AND THEIR LEGENDS</small></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap">n</span> almost every case one finds a variety of differing
legends related by the Indians of any tribe upon the
same subject. As the Wallapais and Havasupais are
cousins, one would naturally expect their legends to
have some things in common. How much this is so
will be seen by a comparison of the following story
with that of the Wallapai Origin Legend.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"The two gods of the universe," said O-dig-i-ni-ni&acute;-a,
the relator of the mythic law of the Havasupais, "are
Tochopa and Hokomata. Tochopa he heap good.
Hokomata heap han-a-to-op&acute;-o-gi&mdash;heap bad all same
white man's devil. Him Hokomata make big row with
Tochopa, and he say he drown the world.</p>

<p>"Tochopa was full of sadness at the news. He had
one daughter whom he devotedly loved, and from her
he had hoped would descend the whole human race for
whom the world had been made. If Hokomata persisted
in his wicked determination she must be saved at
all hazard. So, working day and night, he speedily
prepared the trunk of a pinion tree by hollowing it out
from one end. In this hollow tree he placed food and
other necessaries, and also made a lookout window.
Then he brought his daughter, and telling her she
must go into this tree and there be sealed up, he took
a sad farewell of her, closed up the end of the tree,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
and then sat down to await the destruction of the
world. It was not long before the floods began to
descend. Not rain, but cataracts, rivers, deluges came,
making more noise than a thousand Hack-a-tai-as
(Colorado River) and covering all the earth with water.
The pinion log floated, and in safety lay Pu-keh-eh,
while the waters surged higher and higher and covered
the tops of Hue-han-a-patch-a (the San Franciscos),
Hue-ga-w&#333;&#333;l-a (Williams Mountain), and all the other
mountains of the world.</p>

<p>"But the waters of heaven could not always be pouring
down, and soon after they ceased, the flood upon
the earth found a way to rush into the sea. And as it
dashed down it cut through the rocks of the plateaus
and made the deep Chic-a-mi-mi (canyon) of the
Colorado River (Hack-a-tai-a). Soon all the water
was gone.</p>

<p>"Then Pu-keh-eh found her log no longer floating,
and she peeped out of the window Tochopa had placed
in her boat, and, though it was misty and almost dark,
she could see in the dim distance the great mountains of
the San Francisco range. And near by was the canyon
of the Little Colorado, and to the north was Hack-a-tai-a,
and to the west was the canyon of the Havasu.</p>

<p>"The flood had lasted so long that she had grown
to be a woman, and, seeing the water gone, she came
out and began to make pottery and baskets as her
father long ago had taught her. But she was a woman.
And what is a woman without a child in her arms or
nursing at her breasts? How she longed to be a
mother! But where was a father for her child? Alas!
there was no man in the whole universe!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>"Day after day longings for maternity filled her
heart, until, one morning,&mdash;glorious happy morning
for Pu-keh-eh and the Havasu race,&mdash;the darkness
began to disappear, and in the far-away east soft and
new brightness appeared. It was the triumphant Sun
coming to conquer the long night and bring light into
the world. Nearer and nearer he came, and at last, as
he peeped over the far-away mesa summits, Pu-keh-eh
arose and thanked Tochopa, for here, at last, was a
father for her child. She conceived, and in the fulness
of time bore a son, whom she delighted in and called
In-ya&acute;-a&mdash;the son of the Sun.</p>

<p>"But as the days rolled on she again felt the longings
for maternity. By this time she had wandered far to
the west and had entered the beautiful canyon of the
Havasu, where deep down between the rocks were
several grand and glorious waterfalls, and one of these,
Wa-ha-hath-peek-ha-ha, she determined should be the
father of her second child.</p>

<p>"When it was born it was a girl, and to this day all
the girls of the Havasupai are 'daughters of the water.'</p>

<p>"As these two children grew up they married, and
thus became the progenitors of the human race. First
the Havasupais were born, then the Apaches, then the
Wallapais, then the Hopis, then the Paiutis, then the
Navahoes.</p>

<p>"And Tochopa told them all where they should live.
The Havasupais and the Apaches were to dwell in
Havasu Canyon, the former on one side of the Havasu
(blue water), and the latter on the other side, and occupy
the territory as far east as the Little Colorado and south
to the San Francisco Mountains. The Wallapais were to
roam in the country west of Havasu Canyon, and the
Hopis and Navahoes east of the Little Colorado, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
the Paiutis north of the big Colorado.</p>

<p>"And there in Havasu Canyon, above their dancing-place,
he carved on the summit of the walls figures
of Pu-keh-eh and A-pa-a to remind them from whom
they were descended. Here for a long time Havasupais
and Apaches lived together in peace, but one day an
Apache man saw a most beautiful Havasu woman, and he
fell in love with her, and he went to his home and prayed
and longed and ate his heart out for this woman who
was the wife of another. He called upon Hokomata,
the bad god, to help him, and Hokomata, always glad
to foment trouble, told him to pay no attention to the
restrictions placed upon him by Tochopa, but to cross
the Havasu, kill the woman's husband, and steal her for
his own wife.</p>

<p>"The Apache heeded this evil counsel and did so.</p>

<p>"When the Havasupais discovered the wrong that
had been done them, and the great disgrace this Apache
had brought upon the tribe, they counselled together,
and determined to drive out the Apaches from their
canyon home. No longer should they be brothers.
They bade the Apaches be gone, and when they refused,
fell upon them and drove them out. Up the rocks near
Hue-gli-i-wa the Apaches climbed, and to this day the
marks of their footsteps may be seen. They were
driven far away to the south and commanded never to
come north of the San Francisco Mountains. Hence,
though originally they were brothers, there has ever
since been war between the people of the Havasu and
the Apaches.</p>

<p>"Then, to remind them of the sure punishment that
comes to evil-doers, Tochopa carved the great stone
figures of the Apache man and the Havasupai squaw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
so that they could be seen from above and below, and
there to this day the Hue-gli-i-wa remain, as a warning
against unlawful love and its dire consequences."</p>

<p>Here is another story told by a shaman of the Havasupais
of the origin of the race. It is interesting and
instructive to note the points of similarity and difference.</p>

<p>"In the days of long ago a man and a woman (Hokomata
and Pukeheh Panowa) lived here on the earth.
By and by a son was born to them, whom they named
Tochopa. As he grew up to manhood Pukeheh
Panowa fell in love with him and wished to marry him,
but he instinctively shrank from such incestuous intercourse.
The woman grew angry as he repelled her, and
she made a number of frogs which brought large volumes
of water. Soon all the country began to be flooded
with water, and Hokomata found out what was the
matter. He then took Tochopa and a girl and placed
them in the trunk of a pinion tree, sealed it up, and sent
them afloat on the waters. He stored the tree with
corn, peaches, pumpkins, and other food, so they would
not be hungry, and for many long days the tree floated
hither and thither on the face of the waters. Soon the
waters began to subside, and the tree grounded near to
where the Little Colorado now is. When Tochopa
found the tree was no longer floating he knocked on
the side, and Hokomata heard him and came and let
him out. As he stepped on the ground he saw Huehanapatcha
(the San Francisco Mountains), Huegadawiza
(Red Butte), Huegaw&#333;&#333;la (Williams Mountain), and he
said: 'I know these mountains. This is not far from my
country.' And the water ran down the Hack-a-tha-eh-la
(the salty stream, or the Little Colorado) and made
Hack-a-tai-a (the Grand Canyon of the Colorado). Here he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
and his wife lived until she gave birth to the son and
daughter as before related."</p>

<p>The way the Wallapai became a separate people is
thus related by the Havasupais:</p>

<p>"A long time ago the animals were all the same as
Indians, and the Indians as the animals. The Coyote
he lived here in Havasu Canyon. One time he go away
for a long time and he catch 'em a good squaw, and by
and bye he have a little boy.</p>

<p>"The little boy grew up to be a man, and he went up
on top (out of the canyon, upon the higher plateaus),
and there he found two squaw. It heap cold on top, and
he get two squaw to keep him warm when he go to
sleep. Then he came back to Havasu, and when his
papa (the Coyote) saw his two squaws he said: 'I take
this one. One squaw enough for you.' But the boy
was angry and said one squaw was not enough. 'When
I lie down to sleep I heap cold. Squaw she heap warm.
Two squaw keep me warm.' The Coyote told his son
not to talk; he must be content with one squaw and go
to sleep. And the squaw was proud that the Coyote
had made her his wife, and she began to taunt the boy,
and when he replied she asked the Coyote to tell his
boy not to talk. And the Coyote was mad and spoke
angrily to his boy.</p>

<p>"When he awoke in the morning his son was gone.
And ten sleeps passed by and still he did not come
back, so the Coyote tracked him up Wallapai Canyon,
and went a long, long way. He reached the
hilltop and still he did not find his son. At last, a
long, long way off he saw him, and he changed him
into a mountain sheep. Then a lot more mountain
sheep came and ran with the Coyote's son, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Coyote could not tell which of the band was his boy.
He looked and looked, but it was all in vain. He tried
to change his boy back again, so that he would no
longer be a mountain sheep, but, as he could not tell
which was his boy, his efforts were in vain, and he had
to go back to Havasu alone.</p>

<p>"For a long time the boy remained as a mountain
sheep, until the horns had grown large upon his head.
Then he changed himself back to a man, and he found
his squaw there, waiting for him, and that is why, to
this day, the Wallapai is to the Havasupai the A-mu-u
or mountain sheep."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The origin of the Hopis is thus related by the
Havasupais:</p>

<p>"Long time ago two men were born near Mooney
Falls. They were twins, yet one was big man, and the
other a little big. They came up into this part of the
canyon (where the Havasupais now live). It was no
good in those days. There was no water and it was
'heap hot.' The little big man he say: 'I no like 'em
stay here. Let us go hunt 'em good place to live
where we catch plenty water, plenty corn.' So they
left the canyon and climbed out where the Hopi trail
now is. Here they stayed in the forest some time,
hunting and making buckskin. After they had got a
large bundle of buckskins dressed, they put them on
their backs and began to walk on to seek the country
of lots of water, where plenty of corn would grow. But
it was hot weather and the load was heavy, and they
soon grew so very tired that the smaller brother began
to cry. As they walked on he cried more and more,
until when they came to the hilltop looking down to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
the Little Colorado River, he said: 'I cannot go any
farther. I am going to lie down here and go to sleep.'
So they both went to sleep, and when they woke up the
big brother said: 'Where you go? You no walk long
way. You heap tired.'</p>

<p>"And the little brother answered: 'I no like go
farther. I go back Havasu. I catch 'em water there.'</p>

<p>"'All right!' replied the big brother, 'I no like
Havasu. I go hunt water and plant corn and watermelons
and sunflowers. You go back to Havasu.'</p>

<p>"And he gave him a little bit of corn, and that explains
why the Havasupais can grow only a small amount
of corn in their canyon, though it is exceedingly sweet
and delicious.</p>

<p>"But the big brother went on and found the places
now occupied by the Hopi, and he settled there. And
as he had taken lots of corn with him and he planted
it, that explains" (to the Havasupai mind) "why the
Hopi has so much corn.</p>

<p>"And the smaller brother found water when he got
back to Havasu, and he planted his corn, and cared for
it, and went and hunted and caught the deer and made
buckskin. Then he found a squaw who made baskets,
and helped him make mescal, and they stopped there
all the time.</p>

<p>"The Hopi brother learned to make blankets, but no
buckskin, so when he wants buckskin he has to come
to his smaller brother in Havasu Canyon."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the early days the Havasupais were undoubtedly
cliff-dwellers, for in a score or more places in their
canyons are houses in the cliffs&mdash;some of them
inaccessible&mdash;which their traditions say were once occupied by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
certain families, the names of which are still remembered.
All throughout the Grand Canyon region, too, from the
Little Colorado River to Havasu Canyon, their
cliff-dwellings, and smaller cliff "corn-houses" and mescal
pits, are to be found. Indeed, the Havasupais built all
the trails that are now being claimed as the work of
white men into the heart of the Grand Canyon. The
Tanner-French trail, the Red Canyon trail, the old Hance
trail, the Grand View, Bright Angel, and Mystic Spring
trails, are all old Indian trails. Not only are the
cliff-dwellings and mescal pits proof of this, but the
Havasupais can tell the families to whom they originally
belonged and to whom the rights in them have descended.
These rights they rigidly adhere to. It is the white
man who knows no law as far as the Indian is concerned,
and little by little the aborigine has lost springs,
water-pockets, and trails, and is regarded and treated as an
unwelcome visitor.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="mother"></a>
  <div class="figsub" style="width: 272px;">
    <img class="border" src="images/image39l.jpg" width="272" height="342" alt="Havasupai Mother and Child." />
    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Havasupai Mother and Child.</span></p>

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Family Group of Havasupais.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>By this it must not be inferred that the Indians built
the trails as white men build. In the main their trails
were rude paths such as the mountain sheep might
make, but in every case they had one of these rude
pathways down into the canyon somewhere near to
where the modern trails are now located. At the Bright
Angel this path was changed when white engineers took
hold of it, and at Mystic Spring Mr. Bass had built an
entirely new trail, down a different slope, long before he
discovered the Indian trail. Both unite near two great
natural rock-cisterns, and then deviate below, the Indian
trail zigzagging to the left, while Mr. Bass engineered a
new trail of easy grade on the talus to the right.</p>

<p>Some of the Havasupais are returning to the
cliff-dwelling style of homes. My friend Wa-lu-tha-ma is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
forsaking his wood and brush "hawas," and constructing
a house under the cliffs, where, as he quaintly puts
it, he can "keep dry when much rain comes."</p>

<p>It seems to me a reasonable supposition that it was
from the frequency of the occurrence of these corn-houses
in the walls of Havasu (Cataract) Canyon, with
the occasional appearance of a few of the larger houses
used as dwellings by the Havasupais, that the absurd
and romantic yarns had their origin that fifteen, or less,
years ago, were current in Arizona and elsewhere about
this interesting people. The cowboys, miners, prospectors,
and others, who accidentally stumbled upon the
upper entrance to the Havasu Canyon, and wandered
down its meandering course for ten or forty miles, even
to the village of the simple Havasupais, returned to
civilization and propagated and circulated stories that
out-Munchausened Munchausen. They said these people
were cliff-dwellers, living at the present day in the walls
of the canyon; they were of powerful physical presence,
and possessed great endurance. Their fields and gardens
were wonderful, and their peach orchards surpassed
those of most civilized cultivation, and they held in
slavery a lesser people, dwarfs or pigmies, doubtless,
who were cliff-dwellers like themselves, and whom they
compelled by great cruelty to perform the most arduous
labors.</p>

<p>Others, having heard these stories, but whose spirit of
adventure took them no farther than the "rim" of the
canyon, claimed to have looked into the village and side
canyons, and there seen the truth of these stories
demonstrated. They had seen the pigmies and the
gigantic Havasupais, had heard the harsh yells of the
latter at the former, and had seen the frantic endeavors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
of the little people to obey the stern behests of their
masters.</p>

<p>All these yarns are explained by the fact that the
distance of view dimmed the vision; the pigmies were
boys driving the burros or horses, yelling and shouting
as Havasupai boys delight to do, the voices magnified
fifty-fold by the echoing walls of the canyon, while
the parents moved around attending to their own
business, or looked on and occasionally helped by
a shout of encouragement or suggestion.</p>

<h2><a name="ChXV." id="ChXV."></a>CHAPTER XV<br />
<small>THE SOCIAL AND DOMESTIC LIFE OF THE
HAVASUPAIS</small></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">F</span><span class="smcap">rom</span> the cradle to the grave the life of a Havasupai
is practically an out-of-door life. Their
hawas&mdash;even the best of them&mdash;are partially exposed
and open, and in the summer hawas there is no
pretence at what among civilized peoples is essential
privacy.</p>

<p>The games of the Havasupai children seem very few.
I have seen only three. Of the first importance is
shinny, or, as they call it, <i>tha-se-vi'-ga</i>. The goals are
<i>go-ji-ga'</i>, the ball, <i>ta-ma-na'-da</i>, and the playing stick
<i>ta-so-vig'-a</i>. The boys enter into this with the zest one
would expect of such a time-honored game, yet, such
is their general indifference to prolonged effort, they
do not play it very often.</p>

<p>An easier game, but generally left to the girls, is,
<i>hui-ta-qui'-chi-ka to-ho'-bi-ga</i>, which I have fully described
in my book on the Grand Canyon.</p>

<p>The third game is stolen bodily from the Navahoes,
except the name, which with the Havasupais is <i>T&#333;d-wi-ga</i>.
It is the Nan-zosh, and is elsewhere fully described
in these pages.</p>

<p>Such a paucity of games is indicative of low mental
power, lack of imagination and invention, and results
in, or perhaps <i>from</i> a slow, heavy mental temperament.
There is no comparison between the children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
of the same ages of the Havasupais and the Navahoes
or Hopis. And yet, when they enter school, some of
the Havasupais learn with a rapidity equal to that of
these other children.</p>

<p>It seems strange to find a people whose children
have no equivalent for dolls; nothing specifically to
care for. They are capricious in their treatment of
their domestic animals, cats and dogs, sometimes petting
them to excess, and then lifting the yelping or squalling
creatures by the legs, twisting these members over
their backs, or otherwise torturing them.</p>

<p>The boys and the girls, as well as the men and
women, are expert horse riders. Every family has its
horses, and the children ride from their earliest years.
Even as I write I catch glimpses now and then of a
red-shawled girl on horseback and hear the hard strike
of the horse's hoofs as he dashes along at break-neck
speed along the trail near the hawa of my host. All ride
astride, and are as fearless in ascending and descending
the steep trails that give access and egress to their
canyon home as the wildest and most expert of the
Rough Riders.</p>

<p>One of their great sports and gala times is when visiting
Indians&mdash;Navahoes, Hopis, or Wallapais&mdash;come
with fleet horses and races are arranged for. While they
have no "Derby Day," they have days on which half
the personal property of the village is pledged on the
success of certain horses. They are inveterate gamblers;
and blankets, buckskins, saddles, bridles, Navaho
jewelry, horses, burros, and everything "gambleable"
are risked on the outcome. And what an exciting scene
an Indian horserace is, and how picturesque! There
is not so much difference after all in human nature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
when one penetrates below the surface. The reserved
Englishman, the excitable Italian, the vivacious Frenchman,
and the so-called stupid and stolid native aboriginal
American exhibit exactly the same traits of
character under the excitement of a horserace. But
in Havasu Canyon the conditions are quite different
from Ascot, Doncaster, or Newmarket. Here are bucks
dressed in the breech-clout and excitement, and women
gesticulating and waving their si-dram&acute;-as (our large
flaming red or other "loud" colored bandannas,
fastened over the shoulders and across the breast).
Some suppress their excitement, others jabber like
monkeys, and as the horses come to the starting-point
there is just as much talking and din as after the start
is made. One distinct feature is that many horses are
raced without riders. They seem to understand, and
when the signal to "let go" is given they dart off at
full speed, just as if riders were on their backs urging
them forward. Compared with our finely bred, beautifully
chiselled horses, such as one sees, or used to see,
in Lucky Baldwin's or the late Senator Stanford's stables,
what ragged, scrawny, wretched creatures these are;
and yet when they run how they surprise you, how
those ugly limbs seem to limber up, and those sleepy
eyes gain fire!</p>

<p>Gambling at these races is carried to an extraordinary
extent. Men, women, and children alike gamble all
they possess, or even hope to possess. This gambling
spirit has grown wonderfully in the past few years, for,
during the Kohot Navaho's lifetime he constantly used
his powerful influence to discourage it.</p>

<p>Gambling, unfortunately, is not confined merely to
horse-racing. All the afternoon, as I have sat at my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
work, a group of eight women, some young, some middle-aged,
and one old, have gambled without cessation for
five solid hours. Two young mothers had their babies&mdash;surely
not more than two to three months old&mdash;and
the youngest of the women was one of these mothers,
and she could not have been more than eighteen years
of age. Girls gamble at <i>Hui-ta-qui-chi-ka</i> for safety-pins,
and boys for knives and the like, so that now it
is a vice which has affected every individual of the
tribe.</p>

<p>The Havasupai children are expert ball tossers.
With three or four small melons they rival the conjurers
and jugglers of our vaudeville shows in feats of
dexterity, keeping three or more balls in the air at
the same time.</p>

<p>Boys and girls alike run around in the fiercest rain,
their feet and legs wet and the few clothes they have on
absolutely soaked. The idea of changing them has
never seemed to enter their primitive minds, and without
care, without a fire, unless he chooses to build one, the
youngster gets along as best he may. It is a case of the
weaker going to the wall, for here only the strong can
survive.</p>

<p>There is very little attempt on the part of their parents
to control them. They are generally allowed to do as
they choose. I have often seen a little girl take a
cigarette from between her father's lips, give it a few
puffs, and return it, he all the while either indifferent to
or unconscious of the act.</p>

<p>The close proximity of Havasu Creek and its large
ponds or reservoirs, made by the irrigation dams,
naturally suggests that they are swimmers. Observation
confirms this. From earliest childhood they are expert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
swimmers, boys and girls alike learning the art often
before they can walk. I have seen mere babies placed
in the creek and ditches by their parents and older
brothers, and one can scarcely say they are taught to paddle,
for it seems to come instinctively. There is not a
child in the village who cannot swim and dive expertly,
and there is no greater fun than to expend a dozen nickels
by throwing them into one of the reservoirs and having
the children dive for them. Sometimes they can be induced
to bring the coins up in their teeth, even picking
them in that manner from the sandy bed of the reservoir.
They are as expert swimmers as the children of the
South Seas. No Kanaka going out to meet an incoming
steamer could ride the billows more daringly than the
boys and girls of the Havasu swim in the rapid currents
of their little stream. I have been with them to-day for
a couple of hours. The boys dived into deep water
and rose and fell like loons. I amused myself by throwing
a stone into ten or more feet of water, and four or
five of the boys would dive for it and get it almost as
quickly as I could throw it. It was no sooner in than it
was out again. One of the little girls, a sister of one of
the boys, stood watching the sport. She became so
interested that, suddenly, without removing her calico
dress, she jumped into the deep place and enjoyed the
fun with the rest.</p>

<p>Then, a Havasupai man, riding a burro, brought the
animal down into the stream where it was shallow and
had a gravelly bed. For an hour he and the boys
amused themselves by swimming back and forth through
the deep pool, and every now and again one or another
would jump on the creature's back and, hanging on,
overbalance him, or make him turn a somersault. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
burro bore it all good-naturedly and seemed to object
very little to the fun: the only time he showed decided
inappreciation was when the Indians got him down into
deep water and forced his head under for too long a
time.</p>

<p>A little later on a horse was brought, who entered
into the sport as if he were used to it. He swam back
and forth and took to the water as willingly as a child
takes candy. The boys hung on to his mane, got on
his back, his neck, or hung on to his tail, and, to all
seeming, it was all the same to him.</p>

<p>Though they are so fond of the water, the Havasupais
cannot be called in some respects a cleanly people. Far
from it. Though they take the sweat bath almost as a
religious rite<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and their skin is thus kept clean, there is
another kind of cleanliness in which they are very
remiss. It would be unreasonable to expect that people
living in the exposed wicker huts of the Havasupais
could approach anywhere near the ordinary white man's
standard of cleanliness. But certainly they might have
a higher standard than they do. Lice swarm in the
heads of the children and most of the women. On the
other hand, all the younger men are particular to be
cleanly in this regard, and dress their hair with skill and
neatness. Bed-bugs abound in Havasu Canyon as in
no other place on earth. They swarm everywhere, and
are absolutely found in clusters in the sand, under the
old bark of decayed trees, and in every conceivable
and inconceivable lodging-place. The warm sand and
the seductive moisture that obtains during the major
part of the year must be especially conducive to their
breeding, for they are ubiquitous. Yet, strange to say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
I have never known of an instance where a bed-bug has
been brought out of the canyon by a visitor. Though I
have been with the Havasupais scores of times I never
detected one of these vermin either in my clothing or
bedding. The breed seems to be peculiar to the warm,
moist air of the canyon and to be unable to live away
from it, for which we give hearty thanks.</p>

<p>Now and again scorpions may be found, and, after a
rain, I have seen a score of hundred-legged worms (perfectly
harmless) rolled up on the trail between the
village and Bridal Veil Falls.</p>

<p>Rattlesnakes are not common anywhere in those portions
of the canyon much visited by the Havasupais,
but now and then one may be found on the trails or
basking in the sun on the rocks near by. Elsewhere in
this canyon and its many greater or lesser tributaries
they are common, and the Indians can find any quantity
if they are sent for them. In all my years of wandering
to and fro, though, I have not seen a half-dozen rattlesnakes
in Havasu Canyon.</p>

<p>Other pests are mosquitoes, gnats, and a small black
fly which, in certain seasons, persistently lodges in the
eye, causing considerable annoyance, and sometimes
distress and pain. There are not many mosquitoes,
though at times they are troublesome enough to satisfy
one for their scarcity.</p>

<p>Many of the women are expert basket makers, and in
my book on Indian Basketry I have fully explained their
methods of work and the charming nature of their
designs. The Havasu Canyon is a basket maker's paradise,
for the stream is lined for miles with willows
suitable for this work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>The process of making strands or splints of the willows
is a very simple and primitive one. Here as I sit
writing (Sept. 14, 1901), Chickapanagie's squaw has a
lot of willow shoots before her. Taking hold of one end
of the splint in her teeth, she pulls away the cuticle with
her fingers. These alone are her tools, and it is astonishing
the rapidity and regularity with which the process is
accomplished.</p>

<p>As soon as a girl can frame her fingers to the work
of basket making she is required to begin. It is very
interesting to watch the small children in their endeavors
to make the rougher baskets, and then, as they
grow in skill, try the finer work. Pul-a-gas&acute;-a-a is not
more than eight years of age, and yet a basket&mdash;k&#369;-&#369;&mdash;she
brought to me was one of her own make, and it now
occupies a place in my collection. The work is irregular
and crude, but shows skill, and if the child has patience
to stick to it, in time she will become one of the most
accomplished basket makers of the tribe.</p>

<p>As soon as possible after attaining puberty the
Havasupai girls marry, generally between the ages of
thirteen and fourteen. The parents themselves urge
these early marriages. Whether they fear the loss of
virtue in their daughters from evil white men, or the
degenerate young men of their own tribe, I do not know,
but several parents have told me that the sooner their
girls marry, after they are marriageable, the better
pleased they are.</p>

<p>Marriage is generally arranged by purchase. When
a young man sets his affections upon any particular
girl, he contrives to show his preference for her, and,
as soon as he finds that his attentions are agreeable, he
visits his fair one's father or nearest male relative, and
without parley begins to bargain for her as he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
for a horse or any other commodity. The standard
price for a wife is ten to twenty dollars, and where a
trade cannot be made with a pony or blanket, the
money itself is offered. The bargaining completed,
there are no further preliminaries or ceremony, except
that, three weeks or so before the wedding, the
bridegroom takes up his residence in the hawa of the
bride's parents. He is treated as one of the family, and
at night rolls himself up in his blanket and sleeps alongside
his prospective kinsfolk on the floor of the domicile.
At the end of three weeks, if the contracting young
folks are satisfied that their dispositions are harmonious,
and if the marriage settlement is satisfactory, the
wedding takes place. The groom takes his bride, the
old folk take the medium of purchase, and the company
laughs and banters the young husband and wife.
The man takes the woman to his hawa, and the
announcement of their marriage is made by the fact
that they are living together and have assumed marital
relationship.</p>

<p>Sometimes an obdurate father or mother will refuse to
sell a daughter, and thus expresses disapprobation of the
suggested match. Occasionally, as among more civilized
people, the young couple mournfully, but dutifully, acquiesce
in the decision of the older people, but, more
often&mdash;even, also, as white young people do&mdash;they
rebel, and take the decision into their own hands by
eloping and living together. This ends the matter.
The ethics of the tribe are such that cohabitation once
entered upon, the parents have no authority to declare
the marriage void. And, as a further penalty for his
obdurate obstinacy, the father loses the ten dollars or
its equivalent he might have had by being kind and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
complaisant to the desires of the young couple.</p>

<p>The Havasupais are polygamists, and believe in
having as many wives as they can buy and support.
At the time of his death Kohot Navaho had three wives
living with him, and I personally know of two others
that he had discarded on account of old age. When
Hotouta, his oldest son, was living, his mother was a
thrust-out member of Navaho's household. She was
almost blind and decrepit, and Navaho with a wave
of his hand and ten words had dismissed her from his
bed and board. Hotouta had a tender heart and used
to speak very bitterly about the injustice of this custom
which allowed an old and helpless wife thus mercilessly
to be discarded.</p>

<p>Shortly before Navaho's death his oldest wife evidently
"ruled the roost," and it certainly must have
been by other means than her physical beauty. And
yet she was vain of her good looks, for, when I made
her husband's photograph, she became my strong ally
in persuading him to sit before the camera, on condition
that I would make a "sun-picture" of her own
beautiful physiognomy and enchanting <i>tout ensemble</i>.
When I made the photograph, she secured her petticoats
between her legs in such a manner as to make
them appear like rude trousers, and when I commented
upon the unfeminine appearance and asked her to
spread out her skirts in orthodox style, she boxed my
ears with a manner at once decisive, haughty, and jocular,
and bade me proceed as she was or not at all. The
second wife was a meek kind of a creature, who seemed
to be entirely under the dominion of wife number one;
but the youngest wife, a buxom woman of twenty-three
or four summers, evidently knew how to hold her own,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
for she once or twice refused to obey wife number one,
though she readily obeyed the same request when given
by Navaho personally. This woman is now married to
my old host, Waluthama.</p>

<p>Marriage with a white man is unknown among the
Havasupais, and unlawful cohabitation with one is punishable
by death.</p>

<p>The question of marrying is becoming a more serious
one with the Havasupais each year. While occasionally
a man will marry a Wallapai squaw, there is a
strong sentiment against marriage outside of the tribe.
Yet the number of the tribe is so small, and
intermarriage has so long been carried on between them,
that it is no uncommon thing for a young man or
woman to be debarred from choice in marriage. At
the present time G&#333;&#333;-fwho's son can marry but one girl
in the whole tribe without violating their own laws
of consanguinity, about which no people are more
particular.</p>

<p>The present Head Chief&mdash;Kohot&mdash;of the tribe is
Man-a-ka-cha, a heavily built man, who is popular with
the younger element. But he suffers much in comparison
with the former Kohot, Navaho, who died
in 1898.</p>

<p>Kohot Navaho's was a strong face, marked and furrowed
with bearing the cares of his little nation. A
firm chin, powerful nose, gentle mouth, courageous
forehead, eyes which were once fiery as well as piercing,
but of late years had little of their primitive fire,&mdash;these
gave a key to his character, in which firmness, courage,
bravery, and gentle tenderness were commingled. His
whole demeanor was of dignity and pride. No European
sovereign in the days of despotic power could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
have worn the "air" of a monarch more regally than
Navaho. But it was real with him. His kingship was
within himself as well as in the affection of his people.</p>

<p>As might be expected with their powerful physical
development, the men are great wrestlers, and often
may be seen indulging in friendly, but none the less
hard and exhausting bouts, where Havasupai methods
of cross-buttocking and other "throws" are tested to the
utmost. One of the former teachers was an expert
wrestler,&mdash;learned doubtless among the Sioux, with
whom he used to live as a United States teacher,&mdash;and
one secret of the influence he had over the Havasupais
was his ability to "down" them in a wrestling
match. Time and again he had given their best men
great "falls," and the more he threw, the more they
respected and obeyed him.</p>

<p>As runners and trailers they almost equal the Mohaves,
Apaches, and Hopis, though, on the desert, their
endurance is not so great as that of these two desert
tribes. As canyon climbers, however, they surpass
either of them. The climbing muscles, by life-long
and constant practice, are remarkably developed, and
they run up and down the long, wearisome, steep trails
of canyons in a manner to excite the envy of a college
athlete, and the astonishment of one who has, but a
short time before, laboriously and tediously essayed a
brief trip in which ascending or descending a steep trail
was an essential feature.</p>

<p>As riders they are skilful and full of endurance, but
they are neither as graceful nor as daring as the Navahoes.</p>

<p>Men and women both dress the buckskins for which
the Havasupai is so famous. Amole root is macerated
and beaten up and down in a bowl of water until a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
good lather and suds are produced. Then the operator
takes a mouthful of the liquid and squirts it over the
skin, which he manipulates and softens, rubs, scrubs, and
pulls with his fingers and feet, moistening it again and
again as occasion requires. Wild catskins are treated in
the same way.</p>

<p>From this excellent buckskin the men make moccasins
for themselves and their women. The first time I
saw Kohot Navaho he was sitting naked, upon a blanket
outside his hawa, his three wives near by, they cutting
and preparing peaches for drying, he busily engaged
making a pair of moccasins. The sole is of two or three
thicknesses of heavy rawhide, to which the uppers of
buckskin are deftly sewn, with strings of catgut or deer
intestines, the holes being made by a bone awl.</p>

<p>Every summer trading-parties of both Hopis and
Navahoes come down to the village, bringing blankets,
ponies, pottery, and the like, for exchange. In 1898
there were three separate bands of Navahoes and two of
Hopis. Trading is a serious process. Laws of barter
or sale are first made, before the traders open their
packs, and all the people are expected to abide by these
loosely promulgated laws without question. Then the
hawa of the Havasupai host is turned into a store.
Poles are suspended in every possible direction on which
to show off the blankets to best advantage. A crowd
of chattering men and women stand outside, or, now
and again, come inside, during the whole day, and at
night-time the men who have done business come in,
squat on the ground, and spend the hours in smoking,
tale-telling, and gossip.</p>

<p>There is difficulty in the Havasupai mind at trading
for more than one thing at a time. If you wish to buy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
six articles from the same Indian, you cannot pay a
lump sum for the six. Each one must be traded and
paid for separately.</p>

<p>In most things there is no fixed standard of price.
Fictitious values are placed upon articles of no value
whatever, but to which the Indian mind has attached
singular virtue and importance. On the other hand
baskets, which require days to manufacture, taking no
account of the time and arduous labor expended in
gathering the materials, dyes, etc., for that purpose, are
sold at varying prices, but nearly always far too low to
begin to compensate them for the efforts expended.</p>

<p>Yet they are keen traders in their way. "What
can I get out of him?" is the normal attitude of mind,
and the price is made to correspond to what the seller
imagines is the ability of your pocket.</p>

<p>In dealing with them, I adopted the plan years ago,
as a fixed rule, from which I seldom deviate, to state a
figure I will give for things offered to me, and that sum,
no more, no less, is what I will pay. They soon learn
this, and, though at times it seems to be a disadvantage,
it gains the confidence of the Indian and he will the
more readily trade with me.</p>

<p>I once excited the hearty laughter and some scorn
of the Havasupais by buying a lot of old baskets,
blankets, etc., that they had long deemed of no value.
I was seeking their older styles of work and urged them
to bring me "any old trash" they had discarded. The
usual crowd assembled around my camp, and, as each
specimen of dilapidation was half-shamefacedly revealed
a shout of laughter arose, directed partially at the would-be
seller for her temerity in supposing that such rubbish
could ever find a purchaser, and partially at myself for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
being so foolish as to want to carry it away. But I
obtained some fine specimens, though much worn, of
the workmanship I desired, so could afford to be very
complaisant at the derision I aroused.</p>

<p>The Havasupai is one of the most jolly, frolicsome,
and light-hearted of mortals. With his stomach full he
has no cares, and he goes into fun with a zest and energy
that are pleasing. He is fond beyond measure of practical
jokes,&mdash;when he is not the victim,&mdash;and cares very
little who suffers so long as he can obtain fun. Consequently
if one meets with a misfortune, especially a
laughable one, he need expect little, if any, sympathy
in Havasu Canyon.</p>

<p>They are a singular mixture of frankness and cunning,
of honor and deception, of truth and frankness, of
reliability and untrustworthiness. They will as deliberately
and coolly lie to a white man about anything and
everything&mdash;if it suits their purpose&mdash;as they will
tell the truth. Ask a man his name&mdash;an insult, by
the way&mdash;and he will lie to you, even though you are
a good friend; as, for instance, when, after being the
guest of "Supai Charley" for several days, I quietly and
without seeming intent asked him his name, which I
knew to be Wa-lu-tha-ma, that I might send him some
gifts I had promised. For a few moments he hesitated,
and then said "Qu-ar-ri"&mdash;a Wallapai name that has
no relation to the Havasus whatever. Sinyela was full
of deception, and yet, when a friend told him he might
catch one of his horses and ride it so far, and we reached
that point and I suggested to him that he take the pony
forward and leave it at the designated spot on his
return, he would not listen to it for a moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>They are petty thieves, but years of experience have
taught me that they could not be persuaded to engage
in larceny on a grander scale. One of my first experiences
in this line was to have some little thing taken
from my camp many years ago (I forget now what it
was). Immediately I sent for Hotouta, and told him the
article must be returned. In a few hours the boy thief
(now a hang-dog looking buck) came and brought back
the article.</p>

<p>On my last visit, coffee and candy were taken from
my sacks at Wa-lu-tha-ma&acute;s hawa, and three necklaces
which I had taken as presents for some of the children.
I spoke angrily to my host of his negligence to protect
my goods when they were in his care, and, as for the
necklaces, said if they were not returned by morning I
should complain to the agent, and have the thief discovered
and punished. Long before sunrise in the
morning the necklaces were returned.</p>

<p>There is a good deal of craft about some of them. For
a long time Captain Jim and a few others had wished to
have a road or trail made around Hue-gli-i-wa that would
make it less dangerous, and add much to the comfort of
the people, who lived both above and below this spot,
when they wished to visit each other. For years nothing
was done. But when, this year, he took the matter up
again, he did it in a round-about way that won success.
He urged that an invitation be sent to the leading
horsemen of the Wallapais to bring their best horses
and come and run races with them. The Wallapais
accepted the invitation. Now was Captain Jim's
opportunity for the display of his finesse. He casually
suggested to some of the most ardent racers that the
way to beat the Wallapais was to make a race-track
just the same as the white men did, and, when it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
completed, train their horses to run on it until they
were so familiar with it that, when the Wallapais
came, they would be able to take all the advantages
this additional knowledge would give. The suggestion
worked like a charm. It was Tom Sawyer's woodpile
over again. The young men waited on the Kohot,
Manakacha, and asked permission to cut a road a mile
long through the middle portion of the canyon. The
only place where this could be done was just where
Captain Jim desired the road. He was appointed to
see that the work was properly done, and the first few
days of my visit were enlivened by the echoing roars
of the powder explosions that were set off. When I
went down to the lower part of the village it was over
the new and completed road, a full mile in length, and
well cut out and graded. Such a consummation was devoutly
to be wished, and while races are not an unmixed
good, one could tolerate them the easier for the
Havasupais if they would always be the means of
accomplishing such desirable ends.</p>

<p>The Havasupais are far from being dull and stupid, as
casual observers suppose. They can see the point of
things as quickly as some of their white neighbors.
For instance; I have elsewhere, in my Grand Canyon
book, told how Silver, Hotouta's fine horse, was given
to Mr. Bass. This horse has always been an object of
envy to some of the young men of the tribe. Mr. Bass
also bought from Sinyela a red mule of some of my
exciting experiences. Having once had possession of
this mule was in itself an overpowering temptation to
those Indians, who, in the days of Sinyela's ownership,
had been permitted to ride it. Consequently Mr. Bass
was often annoyed by finding, on his return from an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
absence of a few days, that Silver and the mule, one
or both, had been taken from the pasture and ridden
by the Indians. When he completed his trail across
the river and finally established the ferry that bears his
name&mdash;the only ferry, by the way, across the Grand
Canyon, and the only one on the Colorado River
between Lee's Ferry and the one below the mouth of
the canyons&mdash;he decided to swim Silver and the mule
across the river and keep them for use on the north
side. When this was done Chickapanagie was present.
With a twinkle in his eye he said: "Bass heap sopogie
(understand). Havasupai no ride 'em Silvern, and Red
Mule no more."</p>

<p>There is wide diversity in the attitude different members
of the tribe hold towards the whites. Some are
friendly, others openly hostile and ugly, while others
merely receive strangers on sufferance as a necessary
evil, useful for the purchase of baskets and such other
things as they may have to dispose of.</p>

<p>Manakacha was elected to his kohot-ship because
the majority of the men were in favor of keeping out
the whites from Havasu Canyon, and he was ever
averse to the white man.</p>

<p>Those, however, who are friendly, are good and
true friends, as those who knew Hotouta, Spotty, and
others who are gone can testify.</p>

<p>Spotty was a genial, kindly soul, with whom I had
various dealings. He was intelligent and reliable in
his intercourse with me, though a medicine-man and
ready to dispense charms, incantations, and native medicines
on the slightest pecuniary provocation. On one
of my early trips to Havasu I negligently overlooked
taking a sufficient supply of extra films. What an idea!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
To start on such a trip and forget one's camera rolls.
There were about thirty exposures left on my film and
I was sure I should need two hundred and fifty.
Indeed, long before I had reached the Havasupai
village all the roll was exhausted, and no more pictures
could be taken.</p>

<p>I was disgusted with my own want of forethought, and
generally disgruntled, when lo! on sight of Spotty
the idea occurred as if by inspiration: "Why not send
Spotty for it?" No sooner suggested mentally than
I broached the subject. The round trip was a good
fifty-five to sixty miles, and much of the road up Havasu
Canyon, and I must have the roll within twenty-four
hours. Spotty's eye was on the main chance, and
he at once expressed his willingness to go provided
there was "enough in it." "How much you give me?"
he inquired. I considered for a while, and then with a
Pecksniffian air of benignant charity offered him "two
dollar!" "Al lite, I go! Maybe so I go quick you
catch 'em two dollars and a half?" he asked. I studied
over it awhile before committing myself, and then queried
"When you start, Spotty?" Looking up towards hue-a-pa-a
(the man image) on the upper rim of the near
canyon wall, he pointed. "I go when you see 'em
<i>ha-ma-si-gu-va&acute;-te</i> (the evening star)."</p>

<p>"When you come back?"</p>

<p>"I come back next day all same time you see 'em
<i>ha-la'-ha</i> (the moon). Maybe so I come back sooner
you see 'em, you give me two dollar half?"</p>

<p>A twenty-four hours' ride on horseback&mdash;nearly
sixty miles&mdash;through a solitary country where his only
company would be coyotes, mountain lions, and other
wild animals, and a large portion of it ridden in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
dark night, for two dollars, with a bonus of fifty cents
if the trip was made within twenty-four hours&mdash;it was
not extravagant pay, so I cheerfully acceded to his request
for the bonus. But now came the difficulty of fully
explaining to Spotty what I wanted, and where he could
find it. The tent at Bass Camp was divided into five
compartments,&mdash;two small rooms with canvas walls on
either side of a long room which ran through the centre
of the tent, its entire width. Making a plan of the tent
on the ground, so, and giving him the compass points, I
showed that my "all same white man's basket made of
leather," viz., my <a href="#valise">valise</a>, was in the northeast corner of
the southwest room. The film was in the valise, but I also
needed my ruby lamp, so I deemed it best for him to bring
valise and lamp, which latter was separate. Off he went
cheerfully and merrily, and two hours before the moon rose
he was back at the camp with valise and lamp safe and
secure. He received his bonus and we were both happy.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;"><a id="valise">
<img class="border" style="margin-top: 1em;" src="images/image41.jpg" width="250" height="244" alt="Map of the tent at Bass Camp made to show Spotty where he would find the Valise." />
</a></div>

<p>Like all other Indians, they used to have an abnormal
dread of the camera.</p>

<p>One of my Havasupai friends, U-math-ka, thus stated
his reasons for refusing to be photographed. With
graphic gesture of horror and dread he said: "If you
make my picture I die pretty soon. I look at the Sun.
He get heap hot. I no breathe. I lie down. I die!"
When I assured him no possible injury could result, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
yielded to my urgent entreaties so far as to consent to
allow me to make his sun-picture, on the sole condition,
however, that I did not ask him to look at the camera,
or to cease talking (he was relating some Havasupai
myths at the time). His condition was what I desired,
for it enabled me to secure the accompanying natural
and life-like photograph.</p>

<p>In speech the Havasupai tongue is not very musical
or agreeable. The voices of men and women are soft
and sweet, as a rule, and either when singing their rude
aboriginal songs or those that they have been taught
at school, they show a natural appreciation of tone
that is not usual or common. In a sentence the last
syllable of the last word is often a third higher than the
rest of the word. This gives a singularly emphatic
effect.</p>

<p>The voices of the men are not unpleasant, though
generally they are thrown too high&mdash;head tones&mdash;to
be agreeable; and as conversation increases they often
allow their voices to rise to an almost querulous note.
There is a good deal of the chant about it of a half-musical
nature.</p>

<p>The women's voices are usually sweet and musical,
but the language itself does not lend itself to the display
of vocal sweetness. It is not a "liquid" language. It
is full of crooks and twists, gutturals and harsh labials,
and seems to be ground out in angles with a machine-like
regularity. In some cases, the women, having
imitated the querulous tone of some of the men, have
developed a harshness that is disagreeable. The rapidity
with which they learn new words is remarkable.
Lanoman, one of the present policemen, asked me the
English of a number of words, and all during the day I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
heard him repeating them over to himself, and seldom
would he need correction.</p>

<p>The dress commonly worn by the women consists of
a short skirt and waist, made of colored calico, and a
<i>si-dram'-a</i>, which may be described as a rude shawl,
two corners of which are tied obliquely across the chest.
When at work this is often slung over one side of the
body so that one arm is free. Among the Havasupais
the si-dram-a that is most desired and sought after is
one made of four large bandana handkerchiefs, with red
as the choice of colors.</p>

<p>The men, when I first visited them, seldom wore anything
more than the breech-clout except in cold weather,
but as school influences began to permeate the village,
blue overalls and the cast-off trousers and other clothing
of the white man were donned, until now it is a
rare sight to see a man clothed in any other than the
ordinary fashion, though the influence of the outside
Indians is seen in the Spanish "cut" of all home-made
garments. Moccasins are the common foot-gear, though
occasionally a man or woman may be found wearing
"civilized" shoes.</p>

<p>Fish, pork, chicken, all kinds of birds and eggs, are
tabooed as food by the Havasupais, but they eat rats,
deer, antelope, rabbit, prairie dog, and mountain sheep.
They are especially fond of beef, and horse and mule
meat, no matter how the animals come to their death,
are esteemed luxuries. They will even eat lizards and
lice.</p>

<p>The prickly pear and the fruit of the amole, or hosh-kon,
are much favored when ripe. The latter is roasted
in the coals until the outside is completely blackened.
A hole is made in this carbonized surface to let out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
steam, and, when cold, the fruit is eaten as a great
delicacy. I have often eaten and enjoyed it, though it
has a sickish-sweet vegetable taste that at first is
somewhat unpleasant. The pinion nut, sunflower and squash
seeds are also regarded as delicacies. Practice has
made the Havasupais dexterous in eating these
husk-covered seeds. The novice finds it a wearisome task
to hull them, but the expert throws a handful of seeds
into his mouth, cracks the shells, and by skilful
manipulation eats the nuts on one side of his mouth and
expels the shells on the other. When I can do this I
shall make a meal on pinion nuts, as they are of
exquisitely sweet and delicious flavor.</p>

<p>Sunflower seeds, squash seeds, and a variety of wild
grass seeds and corn are parched by the women by
placing them in saucer-shaped baskets&mdash;or k&#369;-&#369;s&acute;&mdash;with
hot ashes, and then tossing them up and down and
to and fro until sufficiently cooked. The seeds are then
scooped out with the fingers, and ground on a slab of
basaltic rock, by rubbing one stone over the other. On
the occasion of one of my visits, when I was the guest
of Chickapanagie, I made the accompanying photograph
of his wife as she thus parched corn in a basket. It
was the placing of a covering of clay inside the k&#369;-&#369;,
to prevent its burning, that led Frank Cushing to the
belief that here was the explanation of the origin of
pottery.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Green squash is cooked after being hacked into pieces
in an apparently reckless but most effective manner.
With the squash in one hand, the woman takes a large
butcher knife in the other and strikes indifferently at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
the squash, turning it around and at different angles
the while. In a few moments chips, as it were, begin
to fall into the cooking pot, and after the exterior is cut
and hacked in every direction the cook begins to slice
it into the pot. When well cooked, it is eaten without
any other improvement than a little salt.</p>

<p>Corn and beans are plentiful with them, and both are
as delicious and tender as any I have ever tasted elsewhere.</p>

<p>Mescal is one of their chief foods. It is made by
them exactly as the Wallapais make it. That fibrous
portion of the plant that cannot be treated in this
manner is boiled, and the drink therefrom, when fresh,
is a sickish-sweet liquid, that, however, might soon
become agreeable. This liquid is of a dark brown color,
and when boiled for a long time becomes a species of
thin molasses.</p>

<p>The Havasupais know no process of fermentation so
far as I have been able to learn, and the elders of the
people long objected to the coming of the white man
because one of the bad things he brought to the Indian
was whiskey and other intoxicants.</p>

<p>Quail and ducks abound in various parts of the Havasu
Canyon region. Even to this day many of the latter
are shot, for sale to the white man, with the arrow instead
of the gun. The Havasupais claim that the arrow
is far less liable to scare away the flock than is the loud
report of a gun, so they keep up their practice with the
antiquated bow and arrow, and some of them show wonderful
skill in their use. I have often placed a ten-cent
piece in a notched stick and enjoyed watching the
young men as they fired their arrows at it at a distance
of fifty paces. Their skill was such that on one occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
I lost a dollar thus within half an hour.</p>

<p>At one time in February I found the canyon alive
with quail, the whirring of whose wings met us on every
hand as we rode along from hawa to hawa.</p>

<p>I am told there is no fish in Havasu Creek above
Mooney Falls, but from the base of this fall on to
the river both large and small fish are abundant. I
rather doubt this, as on the occasion of my attempt to
reach Beaver Falls down the course of the creek from
Mooney Falls I saw no fish, nor signs of any.</p>

<p>One of the Havasupais tells me that mountain sheep
may be seen on the northern rim of the Grand Canyon
in small bands. When the snow is deep upon the Buckskin
Mountains and the Kaibab Plateau they descend
to the more temperate regions of the canyon where
grass may be found in plenty, and then the Paiuti and
Paieed Indians kill them, drying the flesh for later
use. This they do regardless of a territorial law, which
forbids even an Indian killing mountain sheep at any
time. The Indian regards his as a prior right, existing
long before there was any territorial legislature, and he
acts accordingly.</p>

<p>Mountain lions, wildcats, lynxes, coyotes, badgers,
deer, and antelope, with an occasional mountain sheep
and bear, are the larger quarry of the Havasupai
hunters. The deer and antelope they find in the open
grassy glades of the forests on the canyon rim and
reaching towards the desert. The other game is
generally found in the recesses of the canyons or on
the slopes of the far-away mountains of Hue-han-a-patch-a
(the San Franciscos), Hue-ga-wool-a (Williams
Mountain), or Hue-ga-da-wi-za (Red Butte).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>Some of the skins are dressed with the hair on and
are used for clothing, as sleeping mats, or are sold to
the travellers at the trains or traded at the stores on the
railway. But many of the better skins are carefully
tanned and dressed and converted into buckskins, as
before stated.</p>

<p>This, indeed, is one of their staple articles of trade,
good buckskins fetching as high as five dollars and even
ten dollars cash. I have several times seen a blanket
for which I had offered eight dollars or ten dollars
readily exchanged for a simple buckskin, and it is not
an unusual occurrence to note a trade where a fair
Navaho pony is given for a large and well-dressed skin.</p>

<p>The outside Indians that the Havasupais are familiar
with are the friendly Wallapais, whom they call their
cousins, the Hopis and the Navahoes. They have often
had wars with the hated Mohaves, Apaches, and Paiutis.
The Chemhuevis, Pimas, and Maricopas are their distant,
little known, but accepted friends. Far-away Zuni
is Si-u, and still farther Acoma is Ac-o-ca-va, and though
intercourse with the people of these villages is rare, it
has always been friendly.</p>

<p>For the grazing and watering of their horses and other
stock each head of a family has a certain region allotted
to him, over the boundaries of which he may not allow
his stock to wander, except when removing them or
by special permission. Manakacha, the head Kohot,
takes the range formerly owned or controlled by Captain
Navaho, the late Kohot, viz., the region of Black Tanks.
Rock Jones (the chief medicine-man) has Topocobya
Canyon and the plateau above as far as the other side
of the Grand Canyon towards the Mystic Spring Trail,
where begins the territory of Vesna, Captain Burro, and
Chickapanagie. This includes the south banks of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
Grand Canyon towards the Little Colorado River and
including the Mystic Spring, the Bright Angel, the Grand
View, Hance's old and the Red Canyon Trails, in the
neighborhood of which, for centuries, the Havasupais
have been descending. Indeed, it was the Havasupais
who made the "Indian Gardens" that are so charming
a feature of the Bright Angel Trail. Sinyela has the
upper part of Havasu Canyon reaching to Bass's camp
at the Caves, named by the Havasupais Wai-a-mel.
Uta and Waluthama have the lower portion of Havasu
Canyon, around to the head of Beaver Canyon and all
the territory on the south side as far as Hack-a-tai-a&mdash;the
Colorado River.</p>

<p>Thus there are no disputes arising over the wrongful
pasturage of stock, as each Indian regards himself as
bound by the strictest ties of honor not to deviate from
these established and long-observed boundaries.</p>

<p>As I have before stated, the Havasupais at one time
owned the whole of the Kohonino Forest region and
also the trails into Hack-a-tai-a (the Grand Canyon).
From time immemorial they have hunted from Havasu
(Cataract) Canyon to the Little Colorado, and, of
course, have had access to the water pockets, or rock
tanks, in which rain water accumulates all along this dry
and springless region. In talking with one of the Indians
recently he asked me if the Great Father at Washington
could do nothing for him and his people so that
they might still continue to use the water pockets of
their ancestral hunting-ground. He said, "You sabe
Ha-ha-poo-ha (Rain Tank) and Ha-wai-i-tha-qual-ga
(Rowe's Well) and Ha-ga-tha-wa-di-a (the water hole
near Hance's Camp) and Ha-ha-i-ga-sa-jul-ga (Red
Horse Tank), Havasupai use these water holes when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
him go hunt deer and antelope. Now white man him
come and say, 'D&mdash; you, you get away. I've got no
water for any blanked Indian.' We no catch 'em water,
we no go hunt, and we no go hunt we no catch 'em deer
and antelope and jack rabbit, and by-em-by our squaws
and boys and gels go heap hungry. Maybe so you
see 'em Great Father at Washington and you tell him,
and ask him what Havasupai do."</p>

<h2><a name="ChXVI." id="ChXVI."></a>CHAPTER XVI<br />
<small>THE HAVASUPAIS' RELIGIOUS DANCES AND
BELIEFS</small></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> Havasupais do not occupy a high place in
the scale of religious life. They are very different
from the Hopis and Navahoes. They have few ceremonies,
few prayers, and few ideas connected with the
world of spirits. If evil comes upon them they seek to
propitiate the power that caused it. They dance and
pray. But there is no system, no recurrence of elaborate
ceremonials year after year. Indeed, the only
regular dance that I have personally seen is that of the
annual harvest, and that is occasionally omitted. The
Sick Dance, as its name implies, is for the purpose of
healing the sick.</p>

<p>On the second night of my first visit to the Havasupais
my companions and I were invited by Hotouta to
accompany him to one of these harvest thanksgiving
dances. It was a wild and fantastic scene. Gathered
together in a circular enclosure, the fence made of
willow poles bound together with withes of the same
tree, were between one hundred and two hundred Indians
of both sexes in any and all manner of dress and undress.
Three or four bonfires added to the weirdness
by throwing peculiar lights and shadows upon the countenances
of those present. At times there was a silence
which became almost solemn in its intensity, and then
talking and chattering broke out again, as if the sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
of their own voices helped, in some measure, to relieve
the painfulness of the solemnity of this not-very-welcome
religious ceremonial. I was actually gazing upon the
preparations in progress for the sacred peach dance.
One by one the notables of the tribe were pointed out
to me. There stood Kohot Navaho in proud solitariness,
eyeing the preparations with a moodiness which
became his serious and taciturn nature. Not a thing
of importance passed his eye. His keen powers of
observation took in the frivolity of certain young Havasupai
belles as well as the actions of the Chemehuevi
Indian who was to be director of the music of this religious
festival. By his side stood his second son, who,
in gentle and mellifluous speech was talking to those
with whom he came in contact. Hotouta, the second
chief, was by my side, acting as guide, chaperon, and
instructor in the mysteries. Here was his daughter,
a fine buxom lass of sixteen summers, with merry,
laughing eyes, saucy lips, thick black hair, cut with the
usual deep fringe on her forehead, and a voice that
would have been the fortune of an American girl who
desired a place on the operatic stage. Yonder stood
Ha-a-pat-cha, a fine athletic fellow with muscles of steel
and a chest like that of an ox, whose only costume was
the gee-string. He marched to and fro as if consciously
proud of his fine figure, came up at a call from Hotouta
and seemed to be highly pleased with his introduction
to us, although there was an air of condescension in his
handshake which suggested that I was the honored
person. Perhaps I was! <i>Quien sabe?</i></p>

<p>Near by stood Mr. Bass and a special commissioner
sent by the United States Indian Department to report
on the condition of the Havasupais, and seek to gain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
their consent to send their children to the Indian school
at Fort Mohave.</p>

<p>I was too tired that night to stay long. So after an
hour's watching I returned to Hotouta's hawa, stretched
myself out on the sand&mdash;<i>outside</i>&mdash;in my blankets, and
was soothed to sleep by the monotonous chant of the
dancers.</p>

<p>Next day, in a burst of frolicsomeness I exclaimed to
my friend, who was commonly called Tom by the whites:</p>

<p>"Hotouta, why you no let me dance, all same Havasupai?"</p>

<p>It never entered my comprehension that Tom would
regard the remark with serious attention, hence my
astonishment can better be imagined than described
when thoughtfully he turned to me and said:</p>

<p>"Maybe so! Me no know! Maybe so Havasupai
no like 'em you dance. Maybe so they all same like
'em! I see pretty soon."</p>

<p>"Pretty soon" he came back with a cheery "All
right! Navaho say you dance. Havasupai like 'em
you!"</p>

<p>Here was a fine predicament! I had never danced
a step in my life. In the few ball-rooms I had visited
I had been a "wall flower." But in this case I had
provoked the invitation myself, so, after a brief mental
struggle, as gracefully as possible I accepted the consequences
of my own rash speech.</p>

<p>When the hour arrived I placed myself under the
hands of Hotouta, Yunosi his squaw, and their daughter,
in order that I might be properly and appropriately
apparelled for the occasion. The first salutation somewhat
daunted me. Tom said, "You catch 'em white
shirt!" The only white shirt I had was a night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
robe which had done service to such an extent
that I had placed it in my saddlebags when we left
civilized regions for the purpose of wrapping up specimens
of rock to take home. Its "whiteness" may have
been somewhat of a memory. But I brought it forth,
and waited anxiously for Hotouta's approval. He was
delighted, and I felt reassured.</p>

<p>When it was donned, and a pair of blue overalls, I
was ready to receive the painted lines of sub-chieftainship
on my face, and the eagle plume in my hair.</p>

<p>Then, in solemn dignity, we started down, Indian file,
for the dance ground. At least Hotouta and I were
dignified, while behind us Mr. Bass and the special
Indian Commissioner were making frantic endeavors to
hold in their laughter at the rude and brutal (!) jokes
they were making at my expense. We had not proceeded
far before Hotouta stopped me and with solemn
face said: "You dance, you no laugh. Havasupai no
like 'em you laugh!" I promised to be "as sober as a
judge," and not laugh, and again we proceeded, to be
stopped once more by Hotouta, who explained with
perfect seriousness: "Maybe so you dance heap harnegi.
Havasu squaw, she like 'em you. You catch 'em one
squaw. Then you dance more and maybe so you
catch 'em two squaw. She come, all same" (and here
Hotouta illustrated how the squaw might come and
separate me from my male companion to right or left,
and take my hand in the fashion afterwards described).
"She take your hand, all same. You no nip. She no
like 'em you nip." I promised not to "nip," and with
satisfaction Hotouta now led the way to the dance
ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>After a formal introduction to all the chiefs and their
approval given to my being accepted as Hotouta's
brother and a fellow chief with him in the tribe of the
Havasupais, the dance began. This is how it was
conducted.</p>

<p>The "evangelist" sang over a strain of a new song.
A dozen or so of the leaders took it up, and as soon as
they were fairly familiar with it, the others joined in.
Then the women took a hand, literally as well as figuratively,
for they came in and separated the men, interlocking
the fingers, midway between the first and second
knuckle joints, standing shoulder to shoulder, and enlarging
the group until a complete circle was formed.
Then, with a side shuffling motion, moving one foot to
the left and following it rapidly but rhythmically with
the other, the while lustily and seriously singing the
song they had just learned, the dance continued,&mdash;a
dull, monotonous, sleep-producing ceremony, until the
onlooker was awakened by manifestations he little expected
to see at an Indian thanksgiving dance. Very
often it occurs that women of the tribe are affected with
a somewhat similar excitement to that which seizes the
negro when he has "the power." With a shriek, the
woman hysterically leaps within the circle made by
the dancers, and howls and shouts and dances and
jumps, and then, perhaps, throws herself in a heavy
stupor upon the ground. Some will run to the centre
post, and, hanging on with one or both hands, will
swing rapidly around until they fall exhausted to the
ground. When the male members tire of seeing these
excitable females upon the ground, they unostentatiously
step up to the prostrate figures, seize their long thick
hair, swing it over the shoulder, and thus proceed to
drag the now exhausted women to the fires, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
friends of their own sex attend them until they "come
to."</p>

<p>And what did all this ceremony mean?&mdash;for to the
Havasupais it was a ceremony, performed with as much
dignity as we perform our religious services in church
or cathedral. While I was dancing Hotouta was giving
an explanation to Mr. Bass. Each year this dance is
performed as an act of highest devotion to gain the
approbation of "Those Above." The Peach Dance is
the "harvest thanksgiving" dance&mdash;when thanks are
made for the gifts of the past and prayers are offered
for the needs of the future.</p>

<p>The leader of the singing was a Chemehuevi Indian,&mdash;a
tribe located west of the Wallapais and living
mainly on the California side of the Colorado River.</p>

<p>He was a regular "evangelist" amongst the Indians,&mdash;a
native Moody, and gifted enough, musically, to perform
the part of Sankey or Excell. His harangue on this
occasion was an unusually fervent oration, especially
cutting to Hotouta, for he was one of the chief objects
of the "evangelist's" vituperation and abuse. In fact
had Hotouta been a white man he would have gone away
saying the preacher was "horribly personal and disgracefully
abusive" to the leading members of his congregation.
He explained that the reason the tribe had
lost so many of its members last year by the dread
"grippe" was because of their levity. They had
laughed too much, gone hunting and visiting white
men's camps when they ought to have been dancing.
They were allowing the white man to laugh them out
of the traditions of their forefathers. Then he especially
denounced all friendliness to the whites, and singled out
Hotouta, Chickapanagie, Spotted Tail, and one or two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
others who had been the leaders in thus countenancing
the whites, and administered to them severe rebukes.
After this, referring to the offer of the whites to give
them farming implements, food, etc., if they would send
their children to the Indians' school at Mohave, he
urged his hearers to listen to no such proposals. He
said in effect: "Don't send your children to the school
of the white man. If you do they will grow up with the
heart of the white man, and the place of the Havasupai
will know them no more. Your tribe will be broken up,
and then the white man will come and take possession
of your canyon home where the stream ever flows and
sings to the waving of willows by their side. He will
rob you of your corn-fields and of your peach orchards.
No longer will the place where the bodies of your ancestors
were burned be sacred to you; your hunting-grounds
are now all occupied by him, the deer and the
antelope have nearly disappeared before his rifle, and
he is hungry to possess the few things you still have
left. This offer is a secret plot against you. He thinks
if he cannot drive you out he will seduce you out, and
this school is the offer he makes to you, so that he can
get your children into his hands. There he will teach
them to make fun of you; to despise your method of
living; your houses, your food, your dress, your customs,
your dances will all be ridiculed by him, and so
you will lose the favor of 'Those Above,' and you
yourselves will soon die and your name and tribe be
forgotten." In other words, he endeavored to make it
perfectly clear to the assembled Havasupais that the
school proposition was a white man's scheme&mdash;a dodge&mdash;to
get their children away so that eventually
they&mdash;the whites&mdash;might claim the Havasu Canyon for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
themselves.</p>

<p>Thus he exhorted time after time, and, after each sermon,
sang out, line for line, a new song that he desired
them to learn. At first he alone sang, then Navaho and
a few of the older ones took up the strain, and soon all
joined in. Then the dance began, and continued with
unabated zeal and fervor until the "missioner" gave the
signal for rest. Then, after another harangue, another
song was learned, another dance performed, and so on,
<i>ad libitum</i>.</p>

<p>The state of mental exaltation or frenzy, not unlike
those peculiar manifestations of the negroes at revival
meetings, the Shakers, "having the power" etc., is not
uncommon among the Havasupais. At the Thapala
Dance I have seen three women almost simultaneously
suddenly dart from different parts of the dance circle,
and hysterically shrieking, yelling, and singing, foaming
at the mouth, tearing their hair, falling down with violence,
and with appalling disregard to the injury to their
own bodies dash against each other, or on the great central
tree trunk, which stands like a flagpole in the centre
of their dance corral, yield to this uncontrollable frenzy,
and remain under its influence for an hour or more.
During the whole time of their ecstasy, the dance continued
uninterruptedly, except when one of the frenzied
women dashed towards the dancers as if to escape the
circle. Then the man nearest by rudely took her by the
arms, body, or shoulders and thrust her, shrieking, back
into the centre of the circle.</p>

<p>Yunosi gained her present name because of her occult
powers and frenzied visions. After Hotouta's death she
would occasionally wake up and cry out that she saw
the spirit of her husband, "Tom, heap big Supai chief."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
And, strange to say, in these exalted moments she invariably
spoke in the crude English her husband had
taught her and of which she was very proud. Pointing
into vacant space, with glaring eyes and excited voice,
she would declare that she saw "Big chief Tom. He
come back to see me. O Tom! Tom! I see you."
Then turning to her friends and others around, she
would shriekingly ask, "You no see? You no see?"
And thus she gained her name, Yunosi.</p>

<p>Thinking that perhaps the Havasupais used some
herb, drug, or intoxicant, similar to opium, hasheesh, or
the stramonium (jimson-weed) which the Navahoes use
to produce similar frenzies and visions, I took some of
this, which they call smal-a-ga-to-a, and asked several
if they ever used it. In every case the answer was a
sharp "No! Han-a-to-op-o-gi," and one Havasu informed
me it was "very bad. All same white man's
whiskey." Indeed, such has been the excellent teaching
they have received from their ancients, and the
tenacity with which they, as a people, have adhered
to it, it may be safely affirmed that the Havasupais use
no noxious drug, or fermented or intoxicating liquor,
and that they do not know any processes by which they
can be made.</p>

<p>The ways of the Havasupai medicine-men are similar
to those of fakirs in all lands and ages. I have seen
Rock Jones, after examining a patient, jump up and
excitedly exclaim: "I can see into your head and all
through your brains; down your throat and into your
stomach, through your kidneys, bladder, and intestines,
and you are sick, very sick, very heap sick. But I am
a good medicine-man. I can cure you sure, I can cure
you quick. But you must promise to give me five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
dollars. Don't forget I must have five dollars."</p>

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sinyela, with Esuwa, going for Water.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In one case with which I was familiar, the medicine-man
declared that the heart of one sick man had gone
away to the topmost peak of one of the canyon walls.
It would cost several dollars to charm it back, but he
could do it. Yielding to the pleadings of the man
without the heart, he began to exercise his charms and
incantations, and the next day he came in and declared
he had seen it return during the early morning hours,
and his patient would recover. His prognostication
was correct; the man was soon well and strong, and
paid his six-dollar fee for having his heart returned to
him, with due gratitude and thankfulness.</p>

<p>Another man who had been on the trail of some
runaway horses had become overheated and was attacked
severely with cholera morbus. He was brought
into the village nearly dead, his pains increased by a
terrible soreness in his back, caused by severe vomitings.
The medicine-man gave him a large dose of red
pepper, and, after sucking the flesh of his stomach,
bowels, and back, rubbed the body of the sick man with
red pepper, and then began his incantations. Soon he
declared that a Wallapai doctor who hated the Havasupais
had left a long white rope on the trail over
which the sick man passed, and that it was this charmed
rope which had entered his body and caused the sickness.
On the promise of a fee of several dollars, he
expressed confidence that the rope could be successfully
taken from the invalid, and that its removal would
be followed by immediate recovery. After a little time
had elapsed, the crafty charlatan produced a long white
rope, which he said his skill had extracted. Needless
to add, the patient recovered, and to this day extols<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
the wonderful skill and power of his physician.</p>

<p>Of late years a large number of Havasupais have
been carried off with a bilious fever, with marked malarial
symptoms. The usual indifference in the earlier
stages of the disease gives way later on to frantic sweatings
and appeals to the medicine-man, who comes and
sings and seeks by his incantations to remove the evil
something within the patient that causes the disease.
If the sick person is daring enough to apply to the
agency teacher for medicine, he knows that he no
longer need expect any help from the medicine-man,
whose curses will follow him to the world of doom. As
in the world of civilization there is jealousy, sharp and
keen, between the schools of medicine, so do the Havasupai
medicine-men resent any innovations upon their
time-honored customs.</p>

<p>Here, as elsewhere, one man's skill and reputation is
oftentimes maintained by pulling down that of another.
Dr. Tommy used to be a fairly successful medicine-man,
but once, during a fearful epidemic of grippe,
several children died under his ministrations. It was
soon noticed that those parents whose children had
been treated by another medicine-man were active in
spreading the report that "they believed Dr. Tommy
had killed the children by giving them coyote medicine."
And this "tommy-rot" killed him as a medicine-man,
for, though he was never brought to any trial on
account of this charge, he was shunned and ostracized,
and in very rare cases is ever called upon to exercise
his medical powers.</p>

<p>There are now three medicine-men in the tribe, the
chief of whom is Rock Jones, whose Havasupai names
are suggestive. They are: Pa-a-hu-ya&acute; and In-ya-ja-al&acute;-o,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
the former signifying "black," the other "the
rising sun." At-nahl, whose name means a "sack," is the
second in importance, and the youngest is Ma-t&#333;-m&#257;&acute;,
commonly known as Bob. I have just asked Lanoman
which is the best medicine-man of the three, and his
reply when I asked "Who makes the sick people well
the quickest?" was: "All same. All no good. All
make people dead pretty quick!"</p>

<p>Death is supposed to be, in every case, the departure
of the spirit from the body, and when the sick person is
approaching death the friends and relatives, led by the
medicine-man, will often sit around the invalid and sing
their petitions to the departing spirit in the hope that it
may be led to repent and return to the body. If the
patient recovers, the medicine-man takes the credit
(and what pay he can get) for the return of the spirit,
and goes about in high feather, recounting to all he
meets the new instance of his wonderful and occult
power.</p>

<p>One of the greatest insults that can be offered to the
friends of a dead Havasupai is to refer to him. The
reason given to me for this is that whenever a thought
is sent after a dead person it either prevents his spirit
continuing the journey to Shi-pa-pu, or leads him to
desire to return to earth, neither of which are good for
a Havasupai.</p>

<p>One of the school teachers informed me that she once,
in reconvening the school after a holiday, read out the
name of a child that had recently died. The moment
the name was pronounced several of both boys and girls
burst out, some into a wild wailing and others into fierce
and angry denunciations of the wicked white woman
who had thus arrested the spirit of the deceased on its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
journey to the underworld.</p>

<p>The last night of our first visit the Havasupais had a
Sick Dance. When one of their number is very sick or
about to die, the medicine-man summons the principal
men and women of the camp to dance around him, in
the hope of driving away the disease. It so happened
that during our visit one of the young bucks was very
sick, and a dance was ordered for Saturday evening.
It was quite a distance away from our camp, and Vesna,
whose guest we were that night, informed us that we
would not be welcomed. The welcome would have
been overlooked but for our need of rest, and as it was
a mile or two away, it was decided not to attend,
although we could hear the incantations at intervals
during the night. The dance, however, was similar to
such dances elsewhere. The sick man was placed in the
open air and a circle formed around him, while a slow
and solemn dance was engaged in by those in the circle,
and all participated in the chanting of an incantation.
This was kept up during the entire night, the voices of
the singers at times pitched to a very high key. As
soon as one in the circle grew tired, he dropped out
and another took his place, but the dance and chant
never ceased. If a sick man survives the noise and din
and wakefulness of this until morning, it is probable that
his vitality will carry him through, and he will recover.</p>

<p>If death is thought to be certainly near, the best
clothes of the wardrobe are brought out and placed
upon the dying person. A woman's best dress is not
too good for her to die in, and a man's finest garments,
even to the broadcloth cast-off "Prince Albert" received
through the kindness of some white friend in
the East, is deemed the only appropriate gear in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
to meet the dread summons to Shi-pa-pu. When life is
extinct the dressed-up body is wrapped in the best
blanket the hawa affords, and is then ready for the
period of wailing and mourning. Relatives and friends
of the deceased come and sit in the hawa, and as the
spirit moves them they raise their voices in lamentation,
or, singing the bravery, the daring, the good deeds of
the deceased, ask for him a safe journey to the dread
secret places of the underworld. Nothing can be more
doleful than to hear these sad lamentations in the dead
of the night. All is still, except the never-silent stream
which steadily keeps up its murmur as it flows over the
stones. Otherwise the very Angel of Silence seems to
be brooding over the scene, for the babble of the creek
merely accentuates the nearly perfect stillness. Suddenly
a loud, long, minor wail rises from the hawa in the
midst of the willows, and one feels that he can see the
sound ascend to the heights of these enclosing walls,
striking here and there, and then rebounding to opposing
walls, until the canyon is full of voices, wailing one
against the other and making a spirit chorus of infinite
sadness and distress. The imagination unconsciously
suggests that these echoing wails are the sympathizing
spirit voices of men and women&mdash;former inhabitants of
this canyon of the willows&mdash;who have come to weep
with those who weep for their dead loved ones.</p>

<p>There is no fixed period for this wailing, but as soon
as it is satisfactorily concluded the body is tenderly
thrown across the best horse owned by the deceased, if
a man,&mdash;or ridden by her, if a woman,&mdash;and, accompanied
by other animals conveying some of his or her
most desirable treasures, is taken to the burial or burning
ground. Prior to the advent of the white man the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
Havasupais practised cremation, and between Bridal
Veil and Mooney Falls, and also on the rim of the Grand
Canyon, at a place since named Crematory Point, the
remains of scores of burned bodies of men and women
and also of horses were recently to be seen. For it was
deemed of the greatest importance to give the spirit of
the deceased the spirit of his dead horse, upon which he
might ride to the dark abode of the underworld. Before
it was burned, the horse must be strangled, and
this was done by tightly tying a strip of wet buckskin
around his neck, and, as it dried, it rapidly contracted
and thus strangled the doomed animal. Then both
human being and animal were burned.</p>

<p>But even this was not considered a sufficient offering
to the powers of the dead. Returning to the village, a
peach tree in the orchard of the dead man was cut
down that it might also be "dead" and thus accompany
its owner to the spirit world and give him its refreshing
fruit there. On the death of a chieftain or great warrior,
several peach trees&mdash;thapala&mdash;are cut down.</p>

<p>Of late years, however, these customs of cremation,
strangling of horses, burning of treasures, and cutting
down of peach trees have not been as universal as
formerly. Hotouta, the oldest son of Kohot Navaho,
the last of the old chiefs, had great influence with his
people, and Mr. Bass succeeded in convincing him of
the extravagant folly of thus wasting on the dead, to
whom the sacrifices were of no benefit, that which could
be of so much use to the living. Consequently his
influence materially helped to change the custom from
cremation to ground interment. Later, after Hotouta's
death, when several families had gone back to the old
habit of cremation, others exercised their influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
with the Havasupais to lead them to abandon the old
custom. These endeavors were all effective to a large
extent, and, when Captain Navaho, the last great Kohot
the Havasupais will ever have, died in 1898, he was
buried instead of being cremated. Late in 1897, however,
the son of Sinyela died, and though in many
things Sinyela is one of the most progressive of the
Havasupais, he and his brother took the boy's body
across a horse, tied an axe to the corpse, and started up
the canyon towards Topocobya. When they returned
the axe had been used, the horse was strangled, and
burned bones of human and equine bodies in a side
gorge attest the hold the old superstitions and customs
still have upon the Havasupai mind.</p>

<p>And again in the summer of 1899&mdash;May or June&mdash;when
the daughter of the present Kohot and wife of
Lanoman (another son of Sinyela) died, Lanoman
felt that nothing short of the old and time-honored
method of cremation would be suitable for the daughter
of the new chief and the wife of so smart and bright
an Indian as himself. For Lanoman knew more English,
perhaps, than any other Havasupai, and was afflicted
with the not uncommon complaint of great
self-esteem and conceit. Accordingly, the body was
clothed in the finest blankets of the wardrobe, and
many precious things were taken with it to the Havasu
Canyon below Mooney Falls. Tenderly the body was
lowered down the already nearly useless ladder, and
after suitable wailing, the funeral pyre was built, the
body placed thereupon, more wood heaped around
and over the body, and then the whole fired. When
the body was destroyed, the mourners returned, kicking
down the upper portion of the ladder as they did so,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
that no other Havasupai should be burned there, and
also that no white foot should again desecrate the
sacred precincts of the lower Havasu Canyon. Then,
that the favorite horse of the woman thus honored after
her death should follow her to the underworld, it was
taken to the edge of the plateau above, from which the
descent to Bridal Veil and the upper portion of Mooney
Falls is made, the wet strip of buckskin tied around its
neck, and, as the cord dried and tightened, and the
poor animal began to reel and totter in its death
struggles, it was given a push, tumbled over the edge,
and&mdash;instead of descending to the lower canyon at
the foot of the Falls where the burned body was&mdash;fell
on the shelves of limestone accretions which terrace
the canyon at the side of the Falls, bounded from one
terrace to another, and then, to the infinite disgust of
the mourners, lodged there. And there it still remains&mdash;or
what is left of it, for, as I passed by in July, 1899,
though I could not see the animal, the frightful odor of
the carrion ascended to the very heavens.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> volume, crowded with pictures of the marvels and
beauties of the Canyon, is of absorbing interest. Dramatic
narratives of hairbreadth escapes and thrilling adventures,
stories of Indians, their legends and customs, and Mr.
James's own perilous experiences, give a wonderful personal interest
in these pages of graphic description of the most stupendous natural
wonder on the American Continent.&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Public Ledger.</i></p>

<p>A veritable storehouse of wonders.&mdash;<i>Boston Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>There is a ring of actuality about this book.&mdash;<i>Outing</i>, New
York.</p>

<p>The Grand Canyon has never before received such an
exposition either with pen or camera.&mdash;<i>Literary World.</i></p>

<p>He has told his story in so fascinating a manner that one
feels almost within sight and sound of the great canyon.&mdash;<i>San
Francisco Bulletin.</i></p>

<p>The most thorough description of the Grand Canyon of
the Colorado and its surroundings to be found anywhere.&mdash;<i>Chicago
Tribune.</i></p>

<p>He has not been content to describe the wonders in his
own words, but from historical records, from the notes of
explorers and discoverers, and from the accounts of Indian
natives, white hunters, miners, and guides, he has quoted
freely wherever he could find matter of interest and value.&mdash;<i>Argonaut</i>,
San Francisco.</p>

<p>An illustrated work of which too much can scarcely be said
in praise. The Grand Canyon is one of the world's wonders,
and this volume is the most thorough and satisfying
presentation of its many rugged attractions thus far offered.&mdash;<i>San
Francisco Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>There is probably no man in the country who is better
qualified for the writing of such a book than Professor
James.... Too much cannot be said in praise of his
work.&mdash;<i>Arizona Daily Journal-Miner</i>, Prescott, Arizona.</p>

<p>Will be the standard with reference to the main features&mdash;historic,
scenic, and scientific&mdash;of the Great Canyon of the
Colorado.... Legend and tradition are drawn upon for the
dramatic effect and local color, so that in many respects
the book possesses a charm peculiarly its own.... One of
the typical books of the great West.&mdash;<i>Brooklyn Standard Union.</i></p>

transpired which leads me to modify my statement. A young
lady missionary, riding alone, was criminally assaulted by
a Navaho, and almost brought to death's door. When I heard
of it Navahoes were hunting for the culprit. It is to be
hoped he will be found and severely punished.</p>

September, 1902. One of the Navahoes I met there informed me that
he had come as the messenger of my peshlikai friend at Tohatchi,
and he asked, "When <i>klish</i> (the rattlesnake) bit you did you wear the
klish ring?" I answered, "Yes." "Then," said he, "that was the
reason you recovered. Had you not worn it you would speedily have
died." Of course I believed him.</p>
